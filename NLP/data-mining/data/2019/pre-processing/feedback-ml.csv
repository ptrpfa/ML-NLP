4575,99,2,Better but still needs work,I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version The in game display is better organized and the Scores page is vastly superior to the prior version you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list After a modest amount of use the app appears much more stable However it still needs work in many respects The scoring summary is gone so far as I can tell I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play by play The team leaders appears limited to only 1 QB passing 1 player rushing and 2 receivers with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing Especially during the preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages this is very frustrating there's no way for example to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time A more egregious problem is that at least for the Thursday games in week 2 the teams do not switch properly checking on the Atlanta vs Cincinnati game if I tap on the Atlanta Falcons button I get the passing stats for A Dalton if i tap on the Cincinnati button I see the passing stats for M Ryan with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly but it reflects poorly on the product I apologize for the comments length I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback ,0,0,0

4587,99,2,Last update down grade,The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders But you are not able to make folders inside folders I wish you could The bad things about the last update Now typing has lag which is very annoying I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard But now i wish it was back up top at least Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard ,0,0,0

4698,99,2,Reconsidering,Update EN performance has improved considerably from 2 to 3 stars since my last review however the app remains pretty buggy It constantly reports failure to synch it freezes momentarily between all actions it crashes here and thee and the search function sometimes fails to find key words I am borderline thinking of going premium but also keeping an eye for alternatives Note some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7 Previous review After several months of daily use and building about 1K pretty intensive notes I was in the process to put a serious long term commitment to EN but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week in terms of less freezes when trying to do a search so for me it is wait and see to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN but will also be on stand by and looking for possible alternatives I don't have many concerns w the new design as others do but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues,0,0,0

4706,99,2,I give up,Okay Evernote I hope you are listening You had a great idea But 'note' should not be in your name Call it Eversomething The text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text bullets numbered lists indentation etc Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting I don't know but until this is fixed it is not useful And man I've really tried to like Evernote The synching ability among so many platforms was great But I have to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you will read this But I really wish you would understand this huge weakness in your product And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities Please fix this I really want need a proper Evernote ,0,0,0

4711,99,2,Lovehate,Seems like the Evernote religion has passed me by Perhaps there are handy tools that I am missing trainings that are obvious to all but me But really The notes bullet points spacing numbering all fail when i transfer to Word and other systems The resulting formatting problems take longer than just starting over and retyping notes I also find that the left column flickers and the program crashes at every other use About 1 in 4 syncs give an error message All that aside I like calling up notes on my phone ipad and desktop almost whenever I want If this problematic version is intended to induce me to go for another version it doesn't In fact if this version were more solid I'd be tempted to buy the upgrade,0,0,0
4712,99,2,Problems syncing and opening notes,When this app worked I'd give it 4 stars But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync And then I couldn't open all my notes And now it says trouble reaching evernote server Btw the solution to that 1 after I tried reinstalling and rebooting is to log in using user name instead of email or vice versa Whatever you're having a problem w try the other But annoying this happens at all If it works for you this is a pretty good app to help you keep all those notes you scribble down and email yourself in 1 place,0,0,0
4713,99,2,HORRIBLE UPDATE ,Today's update dated March 1 2013 is horrible Every single time I open up the App it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then when I select either 'Title' which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes in alphabetical order or I select 'Created ' the App immediately crashes and closes I have tried this over 50 times I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail I tried deleting the App all together and then reloaded it but still the same problem This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created and even each month is not in alphabetical order THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE I have always been one of your biggest advocates and proponents If this bug isn't fixed pronto I will have to delete Evernote permanently and use a different App ARGHHHHHH ,0,0,0

4716,99,2,DO NOT RELY ON TA MAPS,Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong or maybe a mislabeled street but I am seeing much worse locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area Want to golf Go horseback riding Come to the historic Centro where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house Next problem related to this is the 'Near Me' function First the app couldn't find me Instead it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house Lastly the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed I am definitely unhappy with this version,0,0,0

5176,99,4,Worth every penny ,You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free I thought the same thing and finally ponied up do you really spend that much more less on a cup of coffee and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable Time tables are pretty accurate but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab Has saved me so much in time ,0,0,0

5184,99,4,The best restaurant finding app,The only complaint I have about this app is that unless you live in one of the supported cities it's pretty much useless Even if you do live in a big city the app won't help you at all if you're travelling somewhere smaller which is why I recommend keeping a backup app like Urbanspoon on your iPhone as a backup ,2,2,2
5185,99,4,Nice program quick support ,I bought this app on December 24th I purchased mainly for hunting and the Google terrain map set I had issued where the terrain map would not load and was blacked out All other maps and features worked fine I emailed customer support that night around 11pm and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am Christmas morning Now that's what I would consider excellent support Seems there was a small issue with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd and Saturday the 24th I am all fixed up now and everything works great ,0,0,0

5449,99,4,Great App Gets Better ,This is a great app I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2 Each version is more refined I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version currently 'The Message' when I tap on the Scripture for the day This isn't the case with the iPhone app One always has to change the version from the default There are a couple formatting issue suggestions 1 The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row 2 One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner but there is no way to enlarge it One would think that a simple double tap could bring up the cover art full screen 3 When traveling I don't always have a wifi link so having issues cached is nice In those instances I simply use my Bible app or print version to get the Scripture for the day I don't expect or want ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway com on my device but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app Keep up the good work ,0,0,0
5450,99,4,Very useful,I have used this on countless occasions now It has come in handy and when I do use it the other party is as wowd as I was the first time I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky may be iPhone speech recognitions problems and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny But if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time Overall very pleased with this for just a buck ,0,0,0

5452,99,4,Nice,The adjustments in Snapseed are very good and it's simple to learn and use However I'm not a fan The tools are very specific purpose and I find myself constantly moving back and forth from one limited purpose tool to another If you like a good sample of adjustments presented at one time in one place and on screen at all times Snapseed may not be what you're looking for ,2,2,2

5714,99,4,Didn't work consistently,Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4 I was able to get it to work three times And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate as the dial moves around and then restarts constantly Sometimes a blinking heart shows up The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85 and then 31 Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs same spot It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app Seems to work for some people and not for others Doesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting ,2,2,2

5836,99,4,Great game messed up with payments,This is a finely crafted bubble shooter with great graphics cute characters and fun gameplay that merits 4 or 5 stars HOWEVER that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in game payments of this sort I HATE this type of payment system I would much rather buy the game up front for 1 2 or even 3 If that option becomes available I would definitely buy this game ,2,2,2

7164,99,5,feature request,Pretty good I've edited many photos using this application already Something to probably address is the photo not always saving what you're looking at in the preview The beautify tool is a good example of this as it may look fine in preview but when you save it you don't exactly get the same quality Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated but overall a remarkable app I use this in conjunction with other apps ,0,0,0

7170,99,5,Okay for chains no good otherwise,Great idea for an app and works okay for gas and chain restaurants but that is literally all you will find No grocery stores cafes or anything that is not fast food or large chains No coffee shops other than Starbucks and no foreign foods and definitely nothing remotely healthy Also lacking an option for submissions I was excited at the possibilities for this app but the reality is much more disappointing ,2,2,2
7171,99,5,Fantastic UI but missing a few features,Clear has one of the best designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone iPad It is the way apps should be So simple and easy I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings 1 It would be nice to sync with the desktop iCal and between devices 2 It needs Reminders and Alerts and Due Dates etc 3 Some kind of support for longer notes Right now single tapping an item lets you edit the item Maybe double tapping should let you open an item's detail page where you could enter the due date add an alarm or type a longer note 4 Also sharing a list It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists Though now I admit this is feature creep that could detract from Clear's simplicity ,0,0,0
7172,99,5,Not bad,I just wish it would notify me if I go below a certain dollar amount,2,2,2

7196,99,5,Update is a step backwards ,I've been using Dropbox for quite sometime now I have earned a fair amount of space and I love being able to access all my files from my iPhone iPad MacBook and the Internet via anyone else's computer But these last 2 updates have disabled the save to camera roll feature which I use all the time and have come across several times since the new update Please please please add this feature back I know I can just do a screen shot but i prefer the clean cut copy you receive without boarders from saving images to the camera roll ,0,0,0

7198,99,5,Pretty good app but , Why can't I sign into separate Drop Box accounts ,2,2,2
7199,99,5,That's Great,You should put the folders first And then the files I would put a folder as favorite thus putting all the files inside this as favorite too,2,2,2
7200,99,5,Love but,Can we get push notifications for other things being shared besides just folders My bf is a photographer he often sticks photos in our shared folder would like a notification when things arrive I do have them turned on but never get them ,2,2,2
7201,99,5,Well thought out and easy to quickly access,The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful and makes accessing files on the go far more convenient I also think the latest style refresh is a big positive in the right direction I use dropbox on all of my devices I would like to see sorting within the app improved eg by date but it's good otherwise,0,0,0

7207,99,5,Evernote,This is a very useful and helpful app In my opinion the only thing it's missing is video handling You can add pictures and audio to your notes and I think you should be able to add videos too,2,2,2

7212,99,5,Please add scroll bar and useful word search ,I would give this 5 stars if it had these two additional features Ability to use a scroll bar on iPad and iPhone rather than swipe swipe swipe and more swipe to get to the bottom of a note Ability to keyword search AND GO TO THAT KEYWORD like you can on the laptop version Having search feature for a word does me no good if I can't search within the note to find that word Can you do these two things for iOS please ,0,0,0

7300,99,4,15 min streaming limit,I gotta say overall I like this app although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth The reason is because I start downloading the whole file then start streaming it Once the 15 min is up I then switch to the downloaded file To me this uses more data Why can't I just stream the whole thing Overall though I like everything else about this app,2,2,2
7301,99,4,Good app,Nice and smooth photo streaming from device to device,2,2,2
7302,99,4,SIX stars,Honestly it took me some time to get used to using this application web clipping photo notes sharing etc but now I find this app to be the 'deal killer' the one thing that MUST be on every device The note scanning is so powerful it can read my scribbles take notes in a meeting take pics in evernote throw them out We are now exploring the business application sky's the limit,2,2,2

7305,99,4,Would benefit trying again,Green interface doesn't look or feel good Nor is it more useful Maximizing space to type in should be the goal however it doesn't feel like it The app still works It's clunky and advertising too much It probably isn't even an issue they may have rolled out the advertisements at the wrong time,2,2,2
7306,99,4,Enjoyed it,I started to use evernote since high school but didn't feel that useful Now i am a college student I use evernote in every life I love the highlight section but wish there is more color than yellow Moreover I enjoy the website version as well It is organized and sophistic Thank you for providing this application It is so convenience,2,2,2

7312,99,4,Brilliant Service Awful design,I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college It's a wonderful service and up until the iOS7 redesign the apps have always worked great But the design of this app is terrible It's jumbled confusing and lots of advertising for their service add ons and 'news' get in the way of core functionality Please redesign the app Again,2,2,2

7314,99,4,Pure Awesome,The only reason I moved to iOS7 was to get the newest version of Evernote Let me say I have no idea what everyone is complaining about Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Handy announcements from Evernote The card view is still there you just have to gasp look for a sec If you are having issues contact support before blasting the app And take a deep breath folks Life isn't that bad,2,2,2
7315,99,4,Evernote App,The app is missing a few things compared to the computer based version but overall functionality is pretty good The only reason I don't give the app 5 stars is because the new interface is absolutely ugly Although this is just a personal opinion I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing If this changes I will give it 5 stars,0,0,0
7316,99,4,Not thrilled with iOS 7 version,I love love love Evernote It is the only way I remember anything Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible The new interface seems to have buried things I want most Such as Sync Now and Search Sync seems to be broken regardless I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does using my first sentence Another new annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again working like the desktop version would be better here Finally it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault It is the buggiest iOS I can remember I'm not mad Just frustrated 2 stars is a reflection on the iOS version not the Evernote across platforms,0,0,0

7322,99,4,Lost Everything ,I loved Evernotesthat is Until I download iOS7 With their new and improved look they also did away with everything you ever had saved They did however manage to maintain the notebook namesunfortunately all of the notes within those notebooks were erased I used this app for work and personal businessall files gone Be sure to only use this app for unimportant notes Very disappointed ,2,2,2
7323,99,4,Had to delete and reinstall to fix missing data,I have over 200 notes in Evernote verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted and reinstalled it Logging out and logging back in didn't work The new UI will take some getting used to but feels cleaner and faster than before,0,0,0

7331,99,4,I loved Evernote until today,Evernote is now virtually unusable I was simply trying to toggle check marks in my grocery list yesterday and it would take three or more attempts to acknowledge me and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up without any reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list When the program did finally acknowledge me the check marks would be delayed by about 2 seconds each as if it had to stop and sync between every gesture Do people even test apps before release any more Who thought 'Oh yeah this looks perfect ' should be fired,0,0,0

7471,99,4,Good app but watch for battery drain,I've been using this app to plan and manage an overseas trip It has Ben great so far withstand couple of minor issues When left running in the background on some modes I think it keeps location services on which seems to be draining my battery faster than usual I'm not sure if it is that or in just using it more than normal It'd be great if there was a way to see my 'saves' sorted by distance as well as a way to mark them as seen Finally when I'm using this while traveling I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review but remind me later waits about 5 minutes and them pesters me again so a star off for that,2,2,2
