99,2,Better but still needs work,"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",3,M_208 AppID: 389781154 Src: AppStore_Random

Previous review,
After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK 

On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives

I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration, though, this feature causes a crash Arg!

I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail  I tried deleting the App all together, and then reloaded it, but still the same problem!  This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE!!!!!!!  I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created, and even each month is not in alphabetical order  THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE!!!!  I have always been one of your biggest advocates and proponents  If this bug isn't fixed pronto, I will have to delete Evernote permanently, and use a different App!

99,2,DO NOT RELY ON TA MAPS,"Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I am seeing much worse locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area Want to golf? Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house

Next problem, related to this is the 'Near Me' function First, the app couldn't find me Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house

Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website

Time tables are pretty accurate, but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps, not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you. Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way, and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab.

I emailed customer support that night around 11pm., and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am, Christmas morning! Now, that's what I would consider excellent support. Seems there was a small issue  with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd, and Saturday the 24th. I am all fixed up now and everything works great!",5,M_838 AppID: 287909017 Src: AppStore_Random

I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time.

The UI is a little clunky, and things like tapping in the golf ball icon to measure club distance were a little tough to find. It doesn't look like a button.

Statistics could use some work as well. The charts while fairly easy to read seem disjointed.

99,4,Now with in-app stats!,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that.

Leave a note and tell them where you went, and don't worry, you'll meet thousands of new friends down in that hole!

Default is the lowest cache amount so make sure you turn up the cache amount so you don't find yourself without any maps when you lose service. Make sure you scout your area with the maps you want before hunting so it will cache your map area for when you lose service you still can use your cached maps.

99,4,Great App Gets Better!,"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

99,4,Didn't work consistently,"Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4, I was able to get it to work three times. And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the ""dial"" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.

Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.

Doesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",2,M_1405 AppID: 409625068 Src: AppStore_Random

99,4,Great app!,Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone.

99,4,Great game messed up with payments,"This is a finely crafted bubble shooter with great graphics, cute characters, and fun gameplay that merits 4 or 5 stars.

HOWEVER, that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing. I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free, so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing. 

This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in-game payments of this sort. I HATE this type of payment system. I would much rather buy the game up-front for $1, $2, or even $3. If that option becomes available, I would definitely buy this game.",2,M_1541 AppID: 534342529 Src: AppStore_Random

2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)
3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's ""detail page"" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. 
4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is ""feature creep"" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",5,M_2983 AppID: 493136154 Src: AppStore_Random

Automatic photovideo upload, iPhoto import, works with the Mailbox app, shared folders, photo aggregation on the website and mobile, the ability to store files only on the cloud (saves space on my Mac from old files)

and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real-time, and accessibility of my files from anywhere

I could do without it anymore! Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files?

One suggestion if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll (say, for #TBT), don't automatically re-upload it to Camera Imports! It's already in Dropbox, silly And yes, obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it, I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload",5,M_3358 AppID: Not stated Src: RE2014_app_and_play_store_apps

99,4,Evernote App,"The app is missing a few things compared to the computer based version, but overall functionality is pretty good The only reason I don't give the app 5 stars is because the new interface is absolutely ugly Although this is just a personal opinion, I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing If this changes, I will give it 5 stars",4,M_3403 AppID: Not stated Src: RE2014_app_and_play_store_apps
99,4,Not thrilled with iOS 7 version,"I love, love, love Evernote! It is the only way I remember anything Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible!

The new interface seems to have buried things I want most Such as Sync Now and Search Sync seems to be broken regardless

I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does, using my first sentence 

Another new(?) annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again, working like the desktop version would be better here

Finally, it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote, evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag

The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault It is the buggiest iOS I can remember
