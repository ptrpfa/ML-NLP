99_4520_2,I can't believe you guys removed one of the most useful features of Evernote which was the ability to style lines as either a section subsection paragraph or blockquote That was the only way we could give some hierarchy to our notes Now all my notes are one dimensional and its impossible to organize my thoughts How could the Evernote team consider that this feature was unnecessary Do you guys not use your own app How am I supposed to outline my notes This is really a big let down to an otherwise great update But it's too big an omission for me too be happy about anything else That's why I give it 2 stars,2.0,2.0

99_4575_2,I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version The in game display is better organized and the Scores page is vastly superior to the prior version you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list After a modest amount of use the app appears much more stable However it still needs work in many respects The scoring summary is gone so far as I can tell I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play by play The team leaders appears limited to only 1 QB passing 1 player rushing and 2 receivers with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing Especially during the preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages this is very frustrating there's no way for example to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time A more egregious problem is that at least for the Thursday games in week 2 the teams do not switch properly checking on the Atlanta vs Cincinnati game if I tap on the Atlanta Falcons button I get the passing stats for A Dalton if i tap on the Cincinnati button I see the passing stats for M Ryan with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly but it reflects poorly on the product I apologize for the comments length I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback ,2.0,2.0

99_4587_2,The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders But you are not able to make folders inside folders I wish you could The bad things about the last update Now typing has lag which is very annoying I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard But now i wish it was back up top at least Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard ,2.0,2.0

99_4669_2,I care more about the functionality than the looks so this review will say nothing about the updated look There are some major bugsproblems with the update I am no longer given the option to 'open in' This means I can look at my Numbers spreadsheets but I can't 'open in' Numbers so I can't work with those spreadsheets or enter any info on them Major issue It makes dropbox completely useless for me Please fix this ,2.0,2.0
99_4670_2,This update makes it harder and slower to use The icons for different file types all look very similar which makes it slower to scan through and find the desired file The old version used colors which made it much faster to use,2.0,2.0
99_4671_2,The inverted colors of the icon induce retinal after images and in app the whiteout is hard on the eyes The experience on an iPad Air is one of huge expanses of white or badly contrasting off whitelight blue and stencil thin pale icons battling the brightness of it all The spartan look works fine on an iPhone where there is proportionately less white assaulting the eye with the iPad however I keep trying to reduce the brightness of the display but that only further impacts contrast and legibility Also why is it not possible to change names of files or folders ,2.0,2.0

99_4676_2,It does a poor job at retaining the starred items in memory So I wait a long time for an MP3 to buffer I 'star' it so I won't have to wait next time But then next time it often has to buffer all over again ,2.0,2.0

99_4678_2,Music takes 15 seconds to load after you have selected a song doesn't matter if I'm on Verizon LTE or Wifi also it doesn't play the next song automatically instead you have to open the app go back and pick the next song in the folder You can't even hit the 'next' button to skip tracks Please fix these in the next update Running iOS7 Same issues on iOS 6,2.0,2.0

99_4681_2,It works on a few platforms but I love to keep changing my phones every couple of weeks and this app is not universal on all platforms They need to release this app on more platforms like newer Windows Phone 8 like Lumia 1020 and then it will be true 5 stars Till then sky drive wins,2.0,2.0

99_4690_2,somethings wrong with the last update i only can view pdfs once after opening for the first time cannot view them anymore the latest update fixed the issue of crashes and also can view the pdfs without problem thanks a lot for your work however there is still a problem which is that when you try using the 'open in' option in other iPad applications and ask to open in Dropbox the filed just opened shows up in the iPad Dropbox application but the Dropbox server is not updated meaning that file is not found in the Dropbox folders if you access the folders in a different devicecomputer etc,2.0,2.0

99_4695_2,Cannot open any saved files,2.0,2.0
99_4696_2,The automatic upload feature is ridiculous as there is no intuitive or easy way to stop it Also the delete function is confusing and should have some sort of dialog box informing you that you are about to delete a photo on your ipad not just in dropbox interface and ask you to confirm that you want to do this My wife tried to stop the automatic upload and hit the delete prompt thinking that may stop it We now lost photos of our newborn which we cannot recover Thank you Dropbox you just lost us photos we will never get back ,2.0,2.0
99_4697_2,The latest revision as of 10 January 2013 loops endlessly when trying to upload a 411KB file Had to email it to move to another device,2.0,2.0
99_4698_2,Update EN performance has improved considerably from 2 to 3 stars since my last review however the app remains pretty buggy It constantly reports failure to synch it freezes momentarily between all actions it crashes here and thee and the search function sometimes fails to find key words I am borderline thinking of going premium but also keeping an eye for alternatives Note some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7 Previous review After several months of daily use and building about 1K pretty intensive notes I was in the process to put a serious long term commitment to EN but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week in terms of less freezes when trying to do a search so for me it is wait and see to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN but will also be on stand by and looking for possible alternatives I don't have many concerns w the new design as others do but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues,2.0,2.0
99_4699_2,I love Evernote and have become very reliant on it one of the apps I can't do without however I am without it now because it crashes on open and will not open on iPhone DO NOT load the Dec 12 update Evernote please fix,2.0,2.0
99_4700_2,The app has been unbelievably buggy since the last update Cannot trust using it on iPhone only desktop and iPad ,2.0,2.0
99_4701_2,Brilliant app but crashes on iPad and iPhone,2.0,2.0
99_4702_2,I dislike the latest version My notes randomly disappear They are listed under the wrong name usually by the one that is actually above it I LOVED the version prior to this one This version is making me lose my confidence that my notes are actually being saved ,2.0,2.0
99_4703_2,Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I'm happy to be a premium subscriber The mobile app however seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements ' which are essentially ads now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work I'd subscribe I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration though this feature causes a crash Arg I'm an Evernote evangelist but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app ORIGINAL REVIEW Thanks for your hard work Happy to be a premium subscriber Only suggestion add ability to copy note links,2.0,2.0
99_4704_2,I really wanted a note system I could trust but Evernote just lost all my notes on the upgrade,2.0,2.0
99_4705_2,It seems Evernote did not understand the spirit of iOS 7 The design seems flat for the sake of flatness Usability has been thrown out the door It's very confusing to use the app Simple actions are painfully slow,2.0,2.0
99_4706_2,Okay Evernote I hope you are listening You had a great idea But 'note' should not be in your name Call it Eversomething The text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text bullets numbered lists indentation etc Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting I don't know but until this is fixed it is not useful And man I've really tried to like Evernote The synching ability among so many platforms was great But I have to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you will read this But I really wish you would understand this huge weakness in your product And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities Please fix this I really want need a proper Evernote ,2.0,2.0
99_4707_2,The search function isn't working and I have to sign in every time I open it Evernote needs to fix this Other than that I love Evernote,2.0,2.0
99_4708_2,Was just beginning to trust this app until 7 update Quit working for all practical purposes Will watch for patches and post an updated review I really was wanting this app to be effective They have some silly new process to sell post it notes Not ,2.0,2.0
99_4709_2, The highlighting of words works but the menu that pops up to copy cut paste etc Won't stay open long enough to be used When placing the cursor over text when the keyboard is open makes the text jump every where but where you want the cursor to be,2.0,2.0
99_4710_2,No notes showing up All the notebooks are there but they are all empty Boo,2.0,2.0
99_4711_2,Seems like the Evernote religion has passed me by Perhaps there are handy tools that I am missing trainings that are obvious to all but me But really The notes bullet points spacing numbering all fail when i transfer to Word and other systems The resulting formatting problems take longer than just starting over and retyping notes I also find that the left column flickers and the program crashes at every other use About 1 in 4 syncs give an error message All that aside I like calling up notes on my phone ipad and desktop almost whenever I want If this problematic version is intended to induce me to go for another version it doesn't In fact if this version were more solid I'd be tempted to buy the upgrade,2.0,2.0
99_4712_2,When this app worked I'd give it 4 stars But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync And then I couldn't open all my notes And now it says trouble reaching evernote server Btw the solution to that 1 after I tried reinstalling and rebooting is to log in using user name instead of email or vice versa Whatever you're having a problem w try the other But annoying this happens at all If it works for you this is a pretty good app to help you keep all those notes you scribble down and email yourself in 1 place,2.0,2.0
99_4713_2,Today's update dated March 1 2013 is horrible Every single time I open up the App it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then when I select either 'Title' which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes in alphabetical order or I select 'Created ' the App immediately crashes and closes I have tried this over 50 times I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail I tried deleting the App all together and then reloaded it but still the same problem This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created and even each month is not in alphabetical order THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE I have always been one of your biggest advocates and proponents If this bug isn't fixed pronto I will have to delete Evernote permanently and use a different App ARGHHHHHH ,2.0,2.0
99_4714_2,I was looking for the longest time the save Favorites feature button until I noticed that it only appears when iPad is hold in vertical position upright This was so weird I usually hold my iPad for trip advisor in horizontal position sideways so the button was nowhere to be found I hope that the tripadvisor fixes this UX usability issue soon,2.0,2.0
99_4715_2,Was an excellent app Now crashes on iPod touch since last update Won't open at all Please fix asap ,2.0,2.0
99_4716_2,Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong or maybe a mislabeled street but I am seeing much worse locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area Want to golf Go horseback riding Come to the historic Centro where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house Next problem related to this is the 'Near Me' function First the app couldn't find me Instead it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house Lastly the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed I am definitely unhappy with this version,2.0,2.0
99_4717_2,Most of the hotel reviews especially from poor hotels are fake and most likely posted by employees Notice how after a negative review is posted it is invariably followed by several glowing reviews And because TripAdvisor is paid by the hotels listed on this site they will remove negative reviews if pressured by the hotel,2.0,2.0
99_4718_2,I love this app It helps me a lot when I'm on the trip but one thing that makes me mad that when I click to see the photos It's only show 1 pic and I got stuck I have to delete the app and redownload it again ,2.0,2.0

99_4792_4,Costs too much and too many add ons Despite its many options I've had experienced many issues with this product It has crashed quite a few times already in the last two days moreover why do I have to pay so much for 'add ons' that should be standard such as fonts and dictionary This just shows the developer is being too greedy In addition it seems to be very slow on my nexus 10,2.0,2.0
99_4793_4,Abysmal controls and AI repetitive campaign Fun game abysmal controls and AI Why on earth team 17 opted for touch controls instead of virtual arrows or a d pad I have no idea Now the AI uses grenades or bazooka about 90 percent of the time with absolute perfection Calculating wind speeds and never missing a single shot even if it is necessary to shoot in the complete opposite direction and rely solely on wind Please make it more human and make it use the other weapons a lot more often Plus the campaign is just skirmish no actual missions ,2.0,2.0
99_4794_4,Nice I like it,2.0,2.0
99_4795_4,Awkward menus I bought this app quickly attempted to do my most common types of formatting and found it very slowly and fiddly on my note 2 Much better on the BlackBerry So as quickly as I could I attempt to un install and get a refund can't So am I stuck ,2.0,2.0
99_4796_4,AVG Tried and tried and tried to use the AVG find my phone part of this app Didn't find it once just kept saying try later so I did and kept on trying I paid for this app so I kind of expect it to work Not enough to the app either Dull to use looks Dull and had I not paid for it I would delete in a heart beat ,2.0,2.0

99_4801_4,Not horrible but All in all it's in the tradition of the franchise In campaign mode it's pretty annoying that the AI never misses and the wind is always exactly what it needs to hit ,2.0,2.0
99_4802_4,Ehhh Every level after 19 is ridiculously hard The enemy worms take hardly any damage and seem to aim perfectly through the tiniest spaces while your worms die by 1st or 2nd turn leaving you with 1 worm against 8 or 9 I'm ready to uninstall,2.0,2.0

99_4805_4,Android Very nice app,2.0,2.0
99_4806_4,Same old worms terrible controls The developer has opted for the classic tap either side of the screen to move and drag the reticle to aim touch control system it does not support controller or keyboard input The result is a control system that is borderline unresponsive and makes fine movement or fast movement completely inefficient This game is so tedious to play it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it If you bought this during the sale you got a great deal but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17 I'm disappointed in this lackluster port Overall the game is a great example of what can happen to a great idea when it's executed poorly I am however happy to give Team 17 a few extra dollars and hope they make improvements over time ,2.0,2.0
99_4807_4,Money ripping I have played this game on pc and realised it was released for android platform As soon as i downloaded it and payed for it it is ridiculous that they are still charging so much money for other mini games available in the game Really disappointed with this Please resolve this issue n i'll give this game a 5 star ,2.0,2.0

99_4824_4,There was a time for this app The fact that the app needs me to register after I have paid for it sucks The fact that it makes me do it with no way of turning it off other than hitting later every time it updates is a deal breaker Get a 365 account and use Microsoft's full version of office ,2.0,2.0

99_4939_4,Pretty Good I give it three stars because there's alot of photo editing apps that already have the same features for free you'll get that fifth star whenever the clone effect is added but it's pretty good but no better than the FREE apps with these same effects ,2.0,2.0

99_4975_4,The best one suggestion I'd love to see an option for TRUE black and white saves not just an option for high contrast greyscale That way CCITT compression could be used and the space saving would be dramatic 90 percent of my scans would be fine in high rez 1 bit I've yet to see another app that can save to 1 bit though they can be read by most PDF viewers but given storage size concerns I don't see why scan apps don't include this as an option Great job on all the rest though ,2.0,2.0

99_5175_4,I love how it tests my brain ,2.0,2.0
99_5176_4,You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free I thought the same thing and finally ponied up do you really spend that much more less on a cup of coffee and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable Time tables are pretty accurate but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab Has saved me so much in time ,2.0,2.0

99_5183_4,Great info on Houston restaurants though some restaurant info needs to be updated such as those which have relocated ,2.0,2.0
99_5184_4,The only complaint I have about this app is that unless you live in one of the supported cities it's pretty much useless Even if you do live in a big city the app won't help you at all if you're travelling somewhere smaller which is why I recommend keeping a backup app like Urbanspoon on your iPhone as a backup ,2.0,2.0
99_5185_4,I bought this app on December 24th I purchased mainly for hunting and the Google terrain map set I had issued where the terrain map would not load and was blacked out All other maps and features worked fine I emailed customer support that night around 11pm and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am Christmas morning Now that's what I would consider excellent support Seems there was a small issue with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd and Saturday the 24th I am all fixed up now and everything works great ,2.0,2.0
99_5186_4,I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time I strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app ,2.0,2.0
99_5187_4,I cannot believe how amazing the new changes are If you mountain bike hike camp or travel this is a must need app It now tracks altitude pace speed and about every other stat you need in any unit of measure By far this is the best app I have ,2.0,2.0

99_5189_4,This is hands down the most useful app I had the lite version but decided it was worth the money to upgrade It makes it so much easier than the guess and check on the calendar I love it ,2.0,2.0

99_5208_4,To those concerned that you cannot zoom in on those savvy charts and reference materials included on this app you CAN Let me help Simply tap on the chart or image itself This will then immediately bring it up closer in its own page and then you can get even closer by pinching Just tap the images first my friends This is a great app ,2.0,2.0

99_5449_4,This is a great app I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2 Each version is more refined I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version currently 'The Message' when I tap on the Scripture for the day This isn't the case with the iPhone app One always has to change the version from the default There are a couple formatting issue suggestions 1 The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row 2 One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner but there is no way to enlarge it One would think that a simple double tap could bring up the cover art full screen 3 When traveling I don't always have a wifi link so having issues cached is nice In those instances I simply use my Bible app or print version to get the Scripture for the day I don't expect or want ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway com on my device but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app Keep up the good work ,2.0,2.0
99_5450_4,I have used this on countless occasions now It has come in handy and when I do use it the other party is as wowd as I was the first time I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky may be iPhone speech recognitions problems and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny But if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time Overall very pleased with this for just a buck ,2.0,2.0
99_5451_4,I am truly amazed at how well this app works the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that when I am recording my voice for translation IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS ME I have a very deep voice and I have never had any type of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the correct version I am very very very pleased with this app you should get it ,2.0,2.0
99_5452_4,The adjustments in Snapseed are very good and it's simple to learn and use However I'm not a fan The tools are very specific purpose and I find myself constantly moving back and forth from one limited purpose tool to another If you like a good sample of adjustments presented at one time in one place and on screen at all times Snapseed may not be what you're looking for ,2.0,2.0

99_7164_5,Pretty good I've edited many photos using this application already Something to probably address is the photo not always saving what you're looking at in the preview The beautify tool is a good example of this as it may look fine in preview but when you save it you don't exactly get the same quality Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated but overall a remarkable app I use this in conjunction with other apps ,2.0,2.0
99_7165_5,Galaxy S4 GPE I have a galaxy s4 google play edition and can't save to the external sd card Otherwise great app You can choose the external sd as your save location but it won't save to it ,2.0,2.0

99_7170_5,Great idea for an app and works okay for gas and chain restaurants but that is literally all you will find No grocery stores cafes or anything that is not fast food or large chains No coffee shops other than Starbucks and no foreign foods and definitely nothing remotely healthy Also lacking an option for submissions I was excited at the possibilities for this app but the reality is much more disappointing ,2.0,2.0
99_7171_5,Clear has one of the best designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone iPad It is the way apps should be So simple and easy I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings 1 It would be nice to sync with the desktop iCal and between devices 2 It needs Reminders and Alerts and Due Dates etc 3 Some kind of support for longer notes Right now single tapping an item lets you edit the item Maybe double tapping should let you open an item's detail page where you could enter the due date add an alarm or type a longer note 4 Also sharing a list It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists Though now I admit this is feature creep that could detract from Clear's simplicity ,2.0,2.0
99_7172_5,I just wish it would notify me if I go below a certain dollar amount,2.0,2.0
99_7173_5,They should add the function to buy Starbucks gift cards via iTunes store I wonder if they'll add that when iOS6 comes in with passbook ,2.0,2.0

99_7180_5,3 days won't do I need at least 5 days Seems user friendly and easy to follow Perhaps if it added the ingredients not multiple entries for the some onion per se ,2.0,2.0
99_7181_5,It's very convenient to use however not being able to switch between accounts without un linking the phone would be great Also an improvement in the media player would also help,2.0,2.0
99_7182_5,One feature they should add is being able to import multiple photos to camera roll then it be better,2.0,2.0
99_7183_5,Would be nice to have a grid view of photos other than just the auto upload of camera roll Also would be nice to rename files My last review still not fixed This app doesn't support mobi file uploads Would be nice to save my mobi files,2.0,2.0

99_7196_5,I've been using Dropbox for quite sometime now I have earned a fair amount of space and I love being able to access all my files from my iPhone iPad MacBook and the Internet via anyone else's computer But these last 2 updates have disabled the save to camera roll feature which I use all the time and have come across several times since the new update Please please please add this feature back I know I can just do a screen shot but i prefer the clean cut copy you receive without boarders from saving images to the camera roll ,2.0,2.0

99_7200_5,Can we get push notifications for other things being shared besides just folders My bf is a photographer he often sticks photos in our shared folder would like a notification when things arrive I do have them turned on but never get them ,2.0,2.0
99_7201_5,The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful and makes accessing files on the go far more convenient I also think the latest style refresh is a big positive in the right direction I use dropbox on all of my devices I would like to see sorting within the app improved eg by date but it's good otherwise,2.0,2.0
99_7202_5,Please add support for animated GIFs ,2.0,2.0
99_7203_5,I love the app for allowing me to keep my notes organized and synchrd across devices I also love the feature of sharing stuff with mates The only thing I long for is collaboration on notes,2.0,2.0
99_7204_5,I have a premium account and I use Evernote for business and personal items all day long and I am very frustrated about the new advertisement section I've been graced with despite paying not to have advertisements Also there is no logic behind the new tag section I really like the the tag section but I want to organize what pops up there I can't find a master list of reminders in the app or the desktop version Maybe I haven't looked hard enough but this seems to be a gaping oversight A calandra would be nifty as well,2.0,2.0

99_7210_5,This is really a great app an tool to manage multiple projects and scattered notes I just wish that there was a calendar integration and sub folders within stacks Also in Evernote hello there is no categorizing But make no mistake I swear by this program,2.0,2.0

99_7214_5,I tend to provide reviews on the fly and my only wish is that I could edit them through the app I also wished that there was a way to respond to replies One hotel accurately described itself on TripAdvisor but was misleading on its website but I can't point this out,2.0,2.0

99_7236_5,This would easily be a 5 star app Best idea ever But it loses 2 stars just because I have to download one photo at a time This is a huge inconvenience,2.0,2.0
99_7237_5,Even Google Drive can refresh folders Some simple suggestions to increase usability 1 Currently you have to leave the folder and come back in if you wish to refresh that folder Let me refresh my folder with a refresh button so that I can view changes to files in a more streamlined manner If I am constantly compiling a document on my computer and using my iPad to check that it looks okay or if I am constantly editing a photo and want a high quality true color representation then REFRESH 2 Refresh Button 3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents 4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it 5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button 6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker 7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely 8 Give me an R Give me an E Give me an F Give me an R Give me an E Give me an S Give me an H What does that spell Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to people who don't know they need it yet Yaaay ,2.0,2.0
99_7238_5,This update would be a step up if you could actually see PDF's with it,2.0,2.0
99_7239_5,When I put things into my dropbox folder on my desktop I can find files by date modified by name etc The app has an incomprehensible and un modifyable sorting function It's almost impossible to find files within the app Once you find them on your phone I believe you can 'favorite' them But the challenge is to find them,2.0,2.0
99_7240_5,Was good until the cent updates Now my notes vanish randomly and I keep getting a sync error This app needs added features too,2.0,2.0

99_7242_5,The new update loads slower closes out on me when i press BACK from viewing photos this update has glitches I don't like the search method and I wish you guys would make it easier to find RESORTS hotels similar to the ones you previously looked at like if I viewed a few months ago a 5 star resort with a lazy river it show me similar resorts I would like to stay at in another place state country ,2.0,2.0
99_7243_5,It is impossible to refine a hotel search for specific criteria beyond location price and quality Those are well done and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA Especially during peak seasonal flows many of us travel with pets We have a terrible time finding clean reliable hotels Most sites for pet travel are woefully inadequate How hard would it be to include this as an additional search filter That would bring in helpful reviews that would not only enhance the site experience but also improve the field,2.0,2.0
99_7244_5,Useful improved Happy with the progress on this app but there are many updates that seem to make no change Can't see the names of many boards there needs to be a wrapped text function on board names so long board names can be seen Indexing is very slow too many of my pins take weeks to come up in search,2.0,2.0
99_7245_5,Video playback sucks This is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser then to youtube Please allow for in app playback to bypass all the nonsense,2.0,2.0

99_7247_4,Best of what's available I've purchased a few of these word emulator apps and Office Suite is the best It's very easy to edit with the toolbars I would give it a five but there are some word spacing issues and I've lost edits occasionally when saving to Dropbox,2.0,2.0
99_7248_4,Finally an Office Suite which works great I have gone through so many office suite and tried to find the suite which best support most common Microsoft Office suite applications Finally this suite fills that suite to 80 If the Font package was part of the suite then I would have given 95 and 5 star ,2.0,2.0
99_7249_4,Aside from the occasional glitch pretty good Awesome graphics nice sound just don't expect AC3 or 4 scale naval warfare The battles are not what I'd call real time more a cross between real and turn based Randomly sailing about is also quite pointless due to being able to fast travel almost anywhere The main missions and races are fun however as they are much less repetitive than battling There have been a few bugs but the developer seems to be squashing them quite often ,2.0,2.0

99_7262_4,I just blew 54 to sign up for three months of Weight Watchers because of this ap only to discover that this ap is not nearly as good as the free ap called Lose It When my Weight Watchers membership expires I will continue watching my food intake with Lose It Meanwhile I am monitoring my progress using both aps so the transition will be seemless So far I'm finding that Lose It is much faster and easier to use ,2.0,2.0

99_7270_4,Have been using Google Drive for a few months paid account the desktop app was totally unreliable and failed to sync just too often So came back to Dropbox always syncing smartly and reliably A bit pricey though almost twice as expensive as competitions if you want the extra space,2.0,2.0
99_7271_4,I now see that you must have IO7 or better for the app I didn't wish to upgrade to IO7 on my ipad2 and can't on my orginal ipad I feel you guys tossed us out in the cold,2.0,2.0
99_7272_4,That moment I figured out I could transfer photos from my iPhone to laptop faster via dropbox than plugging my phone into the USB port,2.0,2.0

99_7281_4,My wife and I share a 100GB account and it's amazing So many things Automatic photovideo upload iPhoto import works with the Mailbox app shared folders photo aggregation on the website and mobile the ability to store files only on the cloud saves space on my Mac from old files and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real time and accessibility of my files from anywhere I could do without it anymore Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files One suggestion if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll say for TBT don't automatically re upload it to Camera Imports It's already in Dropbox silly And yes obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload,2.0,2.0

99_7285_4,Dropbox is amazing and perfect for storage and safety I love it I just wish there was an option to change the name of pictures and documents through your phone,2.0,2.0
99_7286_4,I use it to sync files between a desktop laptop iPad iPod and iPhone And for collaborating with others by using shared files and folders I once had a problem on my iPad with an endless loop asking me to connect to iTunes But that turned out to be an Apple problem which for me could only be solved by a complete erase and restore Since the problem only occurred in DropBox I initially assumed it was their problem It was not,2.0,2.0
99_7287_4,I've tried Google Drive Box Skydrive but none of them could upload a 20 minute video I took Dropbox was the only one that accepted my file,2.0,2.0

99_7290_4,Simple just what I needed to make transferring certain photos from phone to computer and vice versa simple Thanks ,2.0,2.0
99_7291_4,This app is really useful for having access to documents while I'm out The one big thing I think it lacks is a way to share folders while you're using the app I'd love to be able to share a folder via the app and I've needed to so this before while I was out but unfortunately this app as of 3113 doesn't have that feature It would be really useful to have ,2.0,2.0
99_7292_4,Very convenient for moving files without connecting to a computer ,2.0,2.0
99_7293_4,I rely on Dropbox for syncing daily annotated PDFs from my iPad to my home computer After today's update sync stopped working,2.0,2.0

99_7295_4,This was a long wait very glad to have this feature ,2.0,2.0
99_7296_4,I use several apps for PDF viewing and one feature that keeps me on the prowl for the holy grail of PDF viewers is an app that supports PDF markup Being a musician and heavy e reader I rely heavily on PDF markup Dropbox give us some simple PDF markup abilities eg highlight pen erase opacity and you will put several PDF viewer apps to bed Couple these features with the ability to share a folder of PDFs with other Dropbox users and you've converted me and countless others to PDF viewing through Dropbox,2.0,2.0
99_7297_4,The new PDF reader is AWESOME ,2.0,2.0

99_7300_4,I gotta say overall I like this app although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth The reason is because I start downloading the whole file then start streaming it Once the 15 min is up I then switch to the downloaded file To me this uses more data Why can't I just stream the whole thing Overall though I like everything else about this app,2.0,2.0
99_7301_4,Nice and smooth photo streaming from device to device,2.0,2.0
99_7302_4,Honestly it took me some time to get used to using this application web clipping photo notes sharing etc but now I find this app to be the 'deal killer' the one thing that MUST be on every device The note scanning is so powerful it can read my scribbles take notes in a meeting take pics in evernote throw them out We are now exploring the business application sky's the limit,2.0,2.0

99_7305_4,Green interface doesn't look or feel good Nor is it more useful Maximizing space to type in should be the goal however it doesn't feel like it The app still works It's clunky and advertising too much It probably isn't even an issue they may have rolled out the advertisements at the wrong time,2.0,2.0

99_7312_4,I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college It's a wonderful service and up until the iOS7 redesign the apps have always worked great But the design of this app is terrible It's jumbled confusing and lots of advertising for their service add ons and 'news' get in the way of core functionality Please redesign the app Again,2.0,2.0

99_7314_4,The only reason I moved to iOS7 was to get the newest version of Evernote Let me say I have no idea what everyone is complaining about Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Handy announcements from Evernote The card view is still there you just have to gasp look for a sec If you are having issues contact support before blasting the app And take a deep breath folks Life isn't that bad,2.0,2.0
99_7315_4,The app is missing a few things compared to the computer based version but overall functionality is pretty good The only reason I don't give the app 5 stars is because the new interface is absolutely ugly Although this is just a personal opinion I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing If this changes I will give it 5 stars,2.0,2.0
99_7316_4,I love love love Evernote It is the only way I remember anything Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible The new interface seems to have buried things I want most Such as Sync Now and Search Sync seems to be broken regardless I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does using my first sentence Another new annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again working like the desktop version would be better here Finally it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault It is the buggiest iOS I can remember I'm not mad Just frustrated 2 stars is a reflection on the iOS version not the Evernote across platforms,2.0,2.0

99_7331_4,Evernote is now virtually unusable I was simply trying to toggle check marks in my grocery list yesterday and it would take three or more attempts to acknowledge me and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up without any reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list When the program did finally acknowledge me the check marks would be delayed by about 2 seconds each as if it had to stop and sync between every gesture Do people even test apps before release any more Who thought 'Oh yeah this looks perfect ' should be fired,2.0,2.0

99_7420_4,This is an overall great update and had made more quickness and also just a smoother running app tripadvisor itself is the best app to find a restaurant or hotel that suits your needs love the consistent users and current up to date reviews only draw is the distance filter is no longer there so it sets 50 mi radius bit far when u want to go 20 or less but besides that amazing ,2.0,2.0

99_7428_4,Reviews are great but Tilripadvisor reads them first They review photos too I have a negative review and they wouldn't post the photos Something about the photos not being clear Bullsh t They were mint and I even had my BF take photos and give them to me Ridiculous Speaking the truth is a problem for them I had undercooked chicken and they didn't want to post that I could've been sick If they prefer to alter reviews then why bother ,2.0,2.0

99_7432_4,I always read all the reviews while we are traveling on the road My husband and I crisscross the country every summer and I am the navigator I find most reviewers to be honest if you read all of them or at least half you can get a pretty good opinion Many times I didn't pay attention to a negative review because I thought they had some sort of personal problem and was sorry afterwards Trip advisor is a good opinion to take into account when you are traveling in a new place and have no idea where to go,2.0,2.0
99_7433_4,The new complete rewrite version is a disappointment Very slow to no response to photo paging requests lack of hotel search facility for a given city and incomplete searches for hotels These are just a few problems I noted on first use of rewritten app Needs some work Hopefully there will be an update released soon This used to be a great app,2.0,2.0
99_7434_4,I find it an useful tool It is helpful to read multiple opinions one can generally wade through the static and determine what fits It has a vast amount of data but be careful and glean from other sources to get information Remember it is a tool to help plan and execute your own trip use many data points and don't look for perfect wisdom Some people's jewels are NOT others treasures Of I had to put a value I would say about 70 accurate including my own ratings I am very picky some people just want to be out of the rain,2.0,2.0
99_7435_4,Love trip advisor I use it every time I'm out of time for restaurants and have never gone wrong I have tried other food apps and they are not even close to being as accurate A plus is the fact they don't mess with rating fast food restaurants Who needs a star rating for a McDonalds Burger King etc Also very good for finding a good hotel,2.0,2.0

99_7440_4,The TripAdvisor App is a shorter and better way to look up something instead of going onto their website and wasting more time Sometimes you can't always find what you are looking for so you have to go on the website but it's the majority I do all of my bookings with TripAdvisor through the app or through the Internet and it still works very well Great job ,2.0,2.0

99_7471_4,I've been using this app to plan and manage an overseas trip It has Ben great so far withstand couple of minor issues When left running in the background on some modes I think it keeps location services on which seems to be draining my battery faster than usual I'm not sure if it is that or in just using it more than normal It'd be great if there was a way to see my 'saves' sorted by distance as well as a way to mark them as seen Finally when I'm using this while traveling I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review but remind me later waits about 5 minutes and them pesters me again so a star off for that,2.0,2.0
