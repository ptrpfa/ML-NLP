4575,2,99,2019-10-11 00:00:00,,,3,12,Better but still needs work,"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product.

Previous review,
After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK 

On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives

I don't have many concerns w the new design, as others do-- but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues",0,M_332 AppID: Not stated Src: RE2014_app_and_play_store_apps,1,1,0

I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration, though, this feature causes a crash Arg!

I'm an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app

Time tables are pretty accurate, but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps, not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you. Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way, and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab.

5264,4,99,2019-11-21 00:00:00,,,5,10,Now with in-app stats!,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. 

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that.

5449,4,99,2019-11-21 00:00:00,,,5,10,Great App Gets Better!,"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the ""dial"" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.

Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.

Doesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",3,M_1405 AppID: 409625068 Src: AppStore_Random,0,1,0

HOWEVER, that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing. I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free, so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing. 

This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in-game payments of this sort. I HATE this type of payment system. I would much rather buy the game up-front for $1, $2, or even $3.

1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices.
2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)
3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's ""detail page"" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. 
4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is ""feature creep"" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",3,M_2983 AppID: 493136154 Src: AppStore_Random,1,1,0

2 Refresh Button
3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents
4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it?
5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button
6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker
7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button  Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely
8 Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an F, Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an S, Give me an H! What does that spell?

I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does, using my first sentence 

Another new(?) annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again, working like the desktop version would be better here

Finally, it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote, evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag

Note sorting and text-friendly organization (ie, lists) have been thrown out the window for a shiny interface and lots of icons and flashy graphics I can't write with the confidence that EverNote will not crash, but HEY, I can take a picture of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey, EverFail, I quit I am canceling my membership today
