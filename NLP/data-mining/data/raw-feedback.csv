99_118881_2,12,problem discovery,With the updates you forgot to put back to edit board cover for iPad users

99_118888_4,6,information giving,This App as created an addition for Pinterest that I didn t have before 
99_118889_4,6,information giving,the app is amazing in my iphone but when I use it on my computer its annoying when I have to pin because it isnt fast to do it so I dont like in my computer I just rather to use it on my iphone but besides that I just love it 
99_118890_4,6,information giving,I can t live without it 
99_118891_5,3,feature request,I liked having the letters on the side so I didn t have to roll through my entire list of boards to pin something 
99_118892_5,3,feature request,Please find a way to sort the DIY and Etsy stuff apart from each other it s frustrating to click on a project only to find you ve been diverted to an Etsy store 
99_118893_4,6,information giving,When you need any sort of idea all you have to do is check Pinterest 
99_118894_4,6,information giving,I absolutely recommend Pinterest although it is addicting 
99_118895_4,6,information giving,If you use Pinterest you need this app 
99_118896_2,12,problem discovery,Sometime I can t click to go to websites but overall good app 
99_118897_5,3,feature request,I still feel all these larger companies should have the email synch up with my app so when I get an alert and click on the email it should go to my app not the web page 
99_118898_4,6,information giving,Now however I just like it they decided to change the entire way you pin the look of everything and made all the type small and not as colorful and pleading to the eye 
99_118899_4,6,information giving,I would never be able to see so many of the wonderful things the world has to offer if not for Pinterest 
99_118900_4,6,information giving,Love using Pinterest to research all kinds of things and usually find info more appropriate for what I want to know then on other search engines 
99_118901_2,12,problem discovery,However it constantly crashes and freezes 
99_118902_2,12,problem discovery,Love using the app but very very annoying they need to fix all the glitches 
99_118903_4,6,information giving,I love that if I need an idea for a craft or have a stain on my carpet I can find ideas or solution for just about everything 
99_118904_4,6,information giving,I learn how to do so many things from Pinterest 
99_118905_4,6,information giving,Learned how to cut my own hair 
99_118906_4,6,information giving,I don t know why some people put one star but they made a mistake 
99_118907_4,6,information seeking,How could you not love it 
99_118908_2,12,problem discovery,Up until like a week ago I ve never had a problem with it before so I don t understand what s going on now 
99_118909_2,12,problem discovery,They need to get this fixed and fast 
99_118910_2,12,problem discovery, nMy only qualm is not being able to easily save pictures 
99_118911_4,6,information giving,That s a minor issue though 
99_118912_4,6,information giving,I love Pinterest the apps are more user friendly than the website BUT there needs to be a way to mark where you stopped browsing on your home feed 
99_118913_4,6,information giving,App never crashes anymore 
99_118914_4,6,information giving,It s helping me to plan a bunch of different things I want to accomplish in the future and I am so excited for that 
99_118915_4,6,information giving,There are quite a few pins that you click on and it will only pull up a picture or take you to a completely different page but other than that when you find those pages that take you right where you need to be there s a world of wonders out there 
99_118916_4,6,information giving,Like any other App it might have its moments but all in all it s fantastic 
99_118917_4,6,information giving,So glad they made this into an app

99_118926_4,6,information giving,Now that the app is better I need an app for more time in the day 
99_118927_2,12,problem discovery,I almost never have any issues with it except sometimes the notifications won t refresh or sometimes the notifications take days to show up 
99_118928_4,6,information giving,I think it s cool you can swipe through apps but I did like the feature when you could swipe back to the previous page which you can t do anymore 
99_118929_4,6,information giving,Great ideas like minded people but the organization for my brain is the best 
99_118930_4,6,information giving,There have been times when the pins take a long time to load but overall it s a great app and I recommend it to anyone 
99_118931_2,12,problem discovery,Ever since the iOS 7 update the app crashes whenever I try to look at my notifications

99_118950_2,12,problem discovery,They need to make some fixes 
99_118951_4,6,information seeking,Why can you drag and drop whole boards but not the pins within a board 
99_118952_4,6,information giving,Recently many updates including the ability to swipe to pin as well as sending pins to another user have added such great quality to the app 
99_118953_4,6,information giving, p n nI highly recommend this app 
99_118954_2,12,problem discovery,Notifications are broken and can t access sent pins 
99_118955_4,6,information giving,I may be slightly addicted to it 
99_118956_2,12,problem discovery,I don t like how you have to comment on them now how i have to scroll through all my boards to get to one and I really hate how you cant have more than one board open at a time with the x s in the corner

99_118958_2,12,problem discovery,This is my favorite app in the world but all of a sudden it starting to crash again and it is really annoying PLEASE FIX THIS

99_118960_4,6,information giving,Once you start you can t stop 
99_118961_4,6,information giving,I love looking at the crisp beautiful images great ideas that are easy to categorize 
99_118962_2,12,problem discovery,The only thing I hate is the bug that shut it s down usually when I inadvertently have too many windows open 
99_118963_4,6,information giving,I m addicted everyone should have a Pinterest 
99_118964_4,6,information giving,So far so good haven t had any problems with it 
99_118965_2,12,problem discovery,Sure would be nice if the app didn t crash so often while I m pinning or just freezes 
99_118966_4,6,information giving,More updates need to be included with this app in order to keep it moving 
99_118967_4,6,information seeking,Which one gets you to the list of categories the home magnifying glass plus sign or person 
99_118968_4,6,information giving,If you like a pin you should not be listed as following them

99_118970_2,12,problem discovery,Now it will not load new pins from people I follow and if I click to view people I follow then it crashes and closes the app

99_118975_4,6,information giving,Whenever I need an idea for anything I can find a ton here 
99_118976_5,3,feature request,I receive a lot of pins and its frustrating that the pins show up small I think it would be cool if it comes up like the pins do when we are pinning 
99_118977_5,3,feature request,Having the pins on the left needs to be moved back to the middle 
99_118978_4,6,information giving,I do wish with all the new updates they made a slide show option because sometimes I just want to flip through my pins instead of having to click on each one one at a time

99_118993_4,6,information giving,You don t have to search and search the stuff that interests on the web its all here you can also add information you others to see 
99_118994_4,6,information giving,I also liked that choosing the board did not close my new pin not allowing me to make any additional changes to the wording if the pin

99_119018_4,6,information giving,If you have numerous boards you now have to click to make the keyboard go away if you change the caption or you can t scroll to the bottom of your board list because the keyboard blocks it

99_119030_4,6,information giving,I don t like that you can t choose board cover with new update

99_119033_4,6,information seeking,can t figure out how to change a board cover after the update 
99_119034_4,6,information giving,I doubt they even posted them

99_119045_4,6,information seeking,So what happened to the option of saving photos from Pinterest directly to the camera roll on iPads 
99_119046_4,6,information giving,Totally counterintuitive and just makes things really difficult 
99_119047_4,6,information giving,It is not user friendly to navigate and there is an issue where I can t pin something because the pin button is out of reach 
99_119048_4,6,information giving,Now I can t email pins and upgrade is sluggish 
99_119049_4,6,information giving,Please put it back 
99_119050_5,3,feature request,And please add tags bc the search feature becomes useless when my description just says cute or adorable and I have to search my entire board to find something 
99_119051_2,12,problem discovery,About half of attempted re pins fail the hide seek bottom dock is a real pain to use and it much much harder to navigate in general than the older version

99_119053_5,3,feature request,They just need to update the layout I fill like everything is hidden I want a better task bar 
99_119054_2,12,problem discovery,This version has crashed many more times than previous ones 
99_119055_5,3,feature request,boards subjects should have some type of restrictions or distinguishing key phrases 
99_119056_2,12,problem discovery,No more crashes and I m happy once again 
99_119057_2,12,problem discovery,App is crashing when trying to send a direct message via email 
99_119058_2,12,problem discovery,The look is bland and apparently Pinterest has forgotten tons of their pinners are DIY and crafting nuts as you can probably can tell I may have a slight problem with Pinterest

99_119069_2,12,problem discovery,I m quite annoyed and would really like them to fix this situation 
99_119070_2,12,problem discovery,Please fix this because otherwise I LOVE this app but it is useless to me if I can t view ANYTHING 
99_119071_5,3,feature request,Please restore a way to open pin links in external browser or let us save photos

99_119324_2,12,problem discovery,Ledmetallicadc After updating it logged me out and every time I try to log in it crashes immediately 
99_119325_4,6,information giving,Drop box as a service is rather annoying as it seems to be made for old people who haven t made the jump to collaborating in real time in the cloud 
99_119326_4,6,information seeking,Why are you following Apple s lead with the crappy dull uninspired look 
99_119327_2,12,problem discovery,Ever since iOS 7 update Dropbox has not worked constantly crashes when it does run it is EXTREMELY slow and there are problems with camera uploading

99_119336_4,6,information seeking,JohnInThisLife Why did you drop support for earlier IOSs 
99_119337_5,3,feature request,Why no backward compatibility to iOS 6 
99_119338_2,12,problem discovery,I think it is a huge mistake to do so 
99_119339_4,6,information giving,I have been a Dropbox user for years and unfortunately must look for another solution unless an iOS 6 version is made available again 
99_119340_5,3,feature request,This app needs to support older OS versions 
99_119341_4,6,information giving,Instead of having multiple paper notebooks or little notes everywhere everything I need to remember or reference goes into Evernote 
99_119342_4,6,information giving,Our minds need Evernote to actually function today as the creative thinking creatures we are and unburden us from the voluminous mundane which informs our thinking 
99_119343_4,6,information giving,While there are still functions which are not yet available on all mobile platforms these do not detract from the unequivocal 5 rating 
99_119344_2,12,problem discovery,I was about ready to leave Evernote because it would often crash and lose my thoughts also the skeumorphic design was painful to look at 
99_119345_4,6,information giving,Never crashes and it s so much simpler than the old version 
99_119346_4,6,information giving,That s high praise these days this app does just what I need it to do and does it well 
99_119347_2,12,problem discovery,The update downloads but the the nook says it can t open the download 
99_119348_5,3,feature request,The app really needs a proper TODO list that functions as a completed and not competed list 
99_119349_4,6,information giving,I use this to keep track of many items the company is great at providing support and they update the software often 
99_119350_4,6,information giving,Please stop all the enhancements 
99_119351_5,3,feature request,It was a wonderful app before and now it almost takes a manual to figure out how to use it 
99_119352_2,12,problem discovery,It crashes less often but still does so 
99_119353_5,3,feature request, n nSecond it needs a way to export multiple notes at once to Word so that notes can be edited and compiled into articles and papers for publishing 
99_119354_4,6,information giving,That s a vote of confidence that this great versatile app will be around for as long as I need it 
99_119355_2,12,problem discovery,It crashes occasionally and the text formatting is bad 
99_119356_2,12,problem discovery,The problems are obvious and I wish they d be fixed 
99_119357_2,12,problem discovery,Latest update crashes constantly 
99_119358_4,6,information giving,Now I know why it s one if the best apps available in all platforms 
99_119359_4,6,information giving,This single app has replaced my GTD apps note apps outliners presentation apps file sharing and with the sync is available everywhere I need 
99_119360_4,6,information giving,Great to have my stuff available in one place 
99_119361_2,12,problem discovery,Reason for only 4 stars is because some features are not available across all platforms 
99_119362_2,12,problem discovery,The app seemingly does not support cut and paste after IOS7 upgrade 
99_119363_5,3,feature request, n nI d give 5 stars but Evernote really need to give feature parity with their desktop version 
99_119364_4,6,information giving,It used to allow adding multiple tags at once 
99_119365_4,6,information giving,Just clip all thoughts you have from any medium to the software and it is recall able 
99_119366_4,6,information giving,Well worth the download and will purchase the subscription once I learn more on how to maximize it 
99_119367_2,12,problem discovery,Ever since EverNote 'upgraded' to iOS7 style it has been a poorly designed bloated app that constantly crashes 
99_119368_4,6,information giving, That said Evernote has made a massive impact in my life in terms of productivity and organization 
99_119369_2,12,problem discovery,Every time I re download the app I then need to wait until it downloads my all my offline notebooks 
99_119370_4,6,information giving,It seemed cool but I just don t take that many notes I thought 
99_119371_4,6,information seeking, n nNow imagine that for invoices reference photos old magazines newspaper articles kids school awards receipts every recipe you own the manual to your dishwasher the color of paint in in your living room the business card of the guy who installed your flooring etc n nWhether we like it or not we need to acquire the skill of information management 
99_119372_5,3,feature request,Please do take out the marketplace and announcement ads though 
99_119373_5,3,feature request,You can t search within a specific notebook without typing in code very time consuming even IF you can figure out how to do it 
99_119374_5,3,feature request,The list of search results should show the line of the found text so you can see quickly if that s what you re looking for without having to open it 
99_119375_5,3,feature request, n nWish I could create tables since I use this mostly to trap info for reference 
99_119376_5,3,feature request,There are things it would be nice if EN could do but maybe we re all getting spoiled 
99_119377_4,6,information giving,This is the only notepad solution I use for my business 
99_119378_4,6,information giving,Whether you want to organize your butterfly collection or organize your dissertation Evernote can help you do it 
99_119379_2,12,problem discovery,As of Dec upgrade it still crashes 
99_119380_2,12,problem discovery,It has become something I rely on but it crashes on my iPhone 
99_119381_2,12,problem discovery,I tried opening it from the App Store but it wouldn t let me 
99_119382_4,6,information giving,This app alone is the first one I recommend to any family member or friend with a new iOS or other device 
99_119383_4,6,information giving,Easy to search for information when I need it 
99_119384_2,12,problem discovery,I sure wish there was a better app than Evernote for this feature set because it has so many bugs and feature limitations 
99_119385_5,3,feature request,Also wish there was a way to view all notes in Flipboard and to display alerts for random notes 
99_119386_4,6,information giving,I don t need any other note taking apps to store my notes 
99_119387_4,6,information giving,Every time I have something come up with in my mind I just simply take a draft in Evernote and tag it as idea 
99_119388_2,12,problem discovery,It crashes constantly 
99_119389_2,12,problem discovery,When I update a note on my PC it takes forever to show up after I sync on phone sometimes I even have to log out and back for it to show up 
99_119390_4,6,information giving,So because of this program I updated my iOS and it changed its look completely and its stability 
99_119391_2,12,problem discovery,It crashes every time within 2 minutes of using it 
99_119392_2,12,problem discovery,Please make it stable and if possible bring back the old UI 
99_119393_5,3,feature request,It would be nice to have a word counter feature though 
99_119394_4,6,information giving,If you are looking for an app to keep all your information from pictures to web links quotes recipes etc This is the ultimate app look no more 
99_119395_4,6,information giving,Blurring out the right side means you can t read or really see that area when the sidebars open anyway 
99_119396_2,12,problem discovery,I currently cannot attach photos without it crashing so I may have to find a replacement soon 
99_119397_2,12,problem discovery,Just installed it on a new iPad I m glad I don t have too much invested in it because I m abandoning it over the font size issue 
99_119398_5,3,feature request,The font is smaller than that of any other app I use and there is NO way to control it short of using Evernote through a web browser which entirely defeats the purpose 
99_119399_4,6,information giving,s problems with this app 5 ptcgkm This is a great app which I have been using for many years 
99_119400_2,12,problem discovery,I tried fixing it myself before contacting support but I made the problem worse 
99_119401_4,6,information giving, n nI recommend Evernote to everyone I meet 
99_119402_2,12,problem discovery,Since the new update the app crashes a lot on my 4s especially when I try to take a photo in the app 
99_119403_2,12,problem discovery,Start crashing 
99_119404_2,12,problem discovery,But since IOS7 it crashes and freezes on a website at least once a week 
99_119405_4,6,information giving,The only way I can continue is to go through iTunes to delete the whole app then reinstall it 
99_119406_4,6,information giving,Love the ease with which other apps can integrate with Evernote 
99_119407_2,12,problem discovery,It constantly reports failure to synch it freezes momentarily between all actions it crashes here and thee and the search function sometimes fails to find key words 
99_119408_2,12,problem discovery,Note some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7 
99_119409_2,12,problem discovery,The problems I ve experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting 
99_119410_4,6,information giving,I am still working on EN but will also be on stand by and looking for possible alternatives 
99_119411_2,12,problem discovery,Yodaman70 Not sure if this is an Evernote or iTunes issues but found this app and two others aren t upgradeable yet 60 other apps no problem 
99_119412_5,3,feature request,It s time for Evernote to take a good hard look at its software and start pulling features 
99_119413_2,12,problem discovery,Still crashes a lot when capturing and attaching photos to the note 
99_119414_5,3,feature request,This app is ok but we need to get these machines to be more than places to brain dump 
99_119415_2,12,problem discovery,And each time a sync error occurs the error report transmission fails as well 
99_119416_5,3,feature request,I would use it exclusively if it had spreadsheet editing capabilities 
99_119417_2,12,problem discovery,Had been five for me but the update one previous to this broke it for whole tribes of us and it took them a week to get the fix out see below 
99_119418_4,6,information seeking,How do these things get out of the gate 
99_119419_5,3,feature request,My only wish list item would be a URL scheme for passing information to the app or opening a search from elsewhere something Launch Center Pro could use 
99_119420_4,6,information giving, n n iOS Redesign nProps to the Evernote team for not just tweaking the look of their app for iOS 7 like so many others 
99_119421_4,6,information giving,Will update rating accordingly 
99_119422_2,12,problem discovery,Tech support tried to help and I m a premium user but none of them came right out and said what was wrong something like 'Sir you are experiencing what millions of others are experiencing '
99_119423_4,6,information giving,We have created an unreliable app 
99_119424_4,6,information giving,Just use Notebooks or OneNote 
99_119425_4,6,information giving,These guys know how to think outside of the box to let a note taking app evolve and immerse itself into your life and business 
99_119426_4,6,information giving, n nHighly recommended note taking app 
99_119427_4,6,information seeking,It s already possible to rearrange boards why not the pins on a single board 
99_119428_4,6,information giving,This app provides me with just that the opportunity to glance at photos and most photos have links for further information 
99_119429_4,6,information giving,Pinterest is now my go to resource whenever I need ideas or inspiration for nearly anything in life 
99_119430_2,12,problem discovery,The only problem is that it s like a giant vortex where I look up and an hour has passed

99_119432_4,6,information giving,This is the easiest way for me to use Pinterest so I don t just spend hours on the site 
99_119433_5,3,feature request,This can be frustrating when your in the middle of adding important ingredients 
99_119434_5,3,feature request, nBut you should be able to rearrange your boards on here

99_119446_4,6,information giving,I m not sure how I managed in life without Pinterest or this app for that matter but it s my 1 go to if I need a little inspiration 
99_119447_2,12,problem discovery,I wish after it crashes you could go back instead of starting over 
99_119448_4,6,information giving,You look further and it was wasn t what you expected 
99_119449_4,6,information giving,You have to arrow back using your browser and it takes you ALL The Way Back to the Beginning of scrolling 
99_119450_4,6,information giving,I ve learned how to do so many things through Pinterest pins and enjoying pinning items of my own

99_119456_4,6,information giving,You can create a board of your own to refer back to also 
99_119457_5,3,feature request, nIt still needs improvements at the functionality level such as allowing a bigger number of secret boards more flexibility in the search of pins pinners and boards and more flexibility in the display on one s pins and boards and boards that are followed 
99_119458_4,6,information giving,I recommend it often 
99_119459_4,6,information giving,I spend hours just looking and getting great ideas 
99_119460_5,3,feature request, I think it could be better by being able to private message someone though you could block the person from messaging if needed 
99_119461_5,3,feature request,Also I think it could be better if a pin could be deleted from your group board like for example if it was inappropriate and you didn t want it on your board and also if you didn t need to follow a person back for them to be added to a group board 
99_119462_2,12,problem discovery,Please fix this I love Pinterest way too much not to use it 
99_119463_2,12,problem discovery,Can t stop pinning

99_119478_2,12,problem discovery,Never had the problem before 
99_119479_2,12,problem discovery,The only suggestions fix the glitch that boots you out and shuts down your iPad on occasion create main topic board to house boards as subtopics e g Main topic 'decorating' and boards under this would be kitchen bedroom etc I just have so many boards it would make things more organized and easier to find 
99_119480_4,6,information giving,I don t understand why fix something that is not broken to really break it 
99_119481_4,6,information seeking,I wish there were no limitations on searches and I know there are thousands of pins so why only show a couple hundred

99_119500_4,6,information giving,Overall it is fun provides a lot of good info 
99_119501_5,3,feature request,The only bad thing about it is that you can t get on it without wifi 
99_119502_5,3,feature request,Minus one star for occasional crashes of the app and I wish there was a better way to keep people from pinning links to spammy websites 
99_119503_4,6,information giving,There are so many recipes and ideas that you can pin now and use as a resource later

99_119548_2,12,problem discovery,If we could just solve these issues it would be awesome 
99_119549_5,3,feature request,The only improvement I suggest is to add the ability to zoom in on the pictures after they have been pinned 
99_119550_2,12,problem discovery,I have had the iPhone 4S and 5s with both of them I had loading issues when saving an image that would freeze and continue to load hours after I have exited the app

99_119575_4,6,information giving,Don t listen to anybody who gave them one star they are just mad because they didn t get any followers 
99_119576_5,3,feature request,The way I think is to categorize first and then comment but once you select a category you ve pinned it and then you must do the several step process of editing 
99_119577_4,6,information giving,It helps me keep track of my pins and makes the easy to find when I need them 
99_119578_4,6,information giving,When I try to pin from Facebook half the time it tells me I need to log in first 
99_119579_4,6,information giving,So sometimes I just skip it and email the item to myself 
99_119580_2,12,problem discovery,I was nvr a big Facebook fan bc it gave too much personal without any personality Pinterest let s your real self shine through whether you intended to or not nI just wish that with the update that they would fix the crashing of my iPad if I have too many windows open or I have left it open too long

99_119617_4,6,information giving,Decks for the backyard was really fun when we were planning our backyard update 
99_119618_5,3,feature request,The only thing I would love added to Pinterest overall is keywords because a lot of times the captions for the pin do not contain any information about what the pin is about and then there is no way to search for it 
99_119619_2,12,problem discovery,I love this site but the app crashes every time I use it 
99_119620_4,6,information giving,Great thing just need more money

99_119625_4,6,information giving,A few updates ago this thing was added where whnevr you pinned something you would have to hold your finger on the screen and slide it

99_119627_2,12,problem discovery,They made a change some where along the way and I can no longer get this app to open my pinterest account using Facebook on my IPad

99_119629_2,12,problem discovery,I have been hoping for a new version to fix the issue 
99_119630_4,6,information giving,Pinterest has made my life so much easier

99_119632_4,6,information giving,When I need to find something Pinterest is my first stop 
99_119633_5,3,feature request,Could add feature that loads more pins when you reach the bottom and run out of pins 
99_119634_2,12,problem discovery,Wish it didn t crash on occasion but other than that it s great 
99_119635_2,12,problem discovery,The down side is that it does indeed crash on you everyonce in a while not constant at all and doesn t pick up where you left off and you will be lucky if you find that specific pin again 
99_119636_4,6,information giving,Just remember that it s probably a good idea to try some things out and see if you like them if not you can delete it off 
99_119637_2,12,problem discovery,I pick up some great ideas crazy photos and so on but occasionally it just puts up colored boxes instead of photos 
99_119638_4,6,information giving,When I posted one image to FB any time anyone clicked on it it went to Pinterest without a way back to FB so I deleted it

99_119659_5,3,feature request,I liked the list better I don t need a picture to know the category 
99_119660_5,3,feature request,My only complaint is that you can t search your own pins or likes as you can on a computer 
99_119661_5,3,feature request,Im a crafter I would like to see more patterns that go with these crafts like the havoc made with recycled bottles there not for sale but there is no pattern either

99_119673_5,3,feature request,Not impressed with update also need to put a sidebar on pins so you can see how far you have to scroll down to get to the bottom of a topic 
99_119674_5,3,feature request,I need to see what I am working on or towards in order for me to make the connection

99_119830_5,3,feature request,Truly you are missing a iconoclastic app 
99_119831_2,12,problem discovery,The problems with the folders is that if you touch one accidentally like hit the one above it pins I to it before you had to hit the PIN button again which gave you the chance to make sure to hanger the folder with one tap now you have to go in and delete and move it to the correct folder 
99_119832_2,12,problem discovery,The latest update does not work well on the iPad

99_119846_2,12,problem discovery,Please fix or allow me to downgrade 
99_119847_4,6,information giving,I love Pinterest and the app is easier to use because you just press on a picture the different options to pin it like and send pop up and all you do is slide to the option

99_120124_2,4,Last Update ios 70 is Disastrous ,I'm SO upset I've been using this app for a year have patiently endured the slow process of improvement It had really gotten quite good Then this last bungled attempt has made the app virtually useless Shame on Evernote's QC group if they even have one

99_120127_2,12,Annoying functionality,When you select an attraction and click around to read reviews and view pictures and then go back to the full like it defaults back to the beginning of the list and you have to hit 'next page' a several times to find the place you left off Very annoying
99_120128_2,4,Doesn't work after the last update,I love Evernote I use it on my Mac and I use it on my iPhone I love the Evernote app but ever since the last update which was a few days ago this app has been giving me nothing but problems Sometimes it just doesn't open All I keep seeing is a blank screen Sometimes it opens up but then while going back and forth between notes or notebooks it simply gets stuck and doesn't respond to any finger taps or actions I hope the Evernote people improve this app and fix these bugs because I truly love Evernote and would like to keep using it But lately I have encountered nothing but serious quality problems with Evernote
99_120129_2,4,Terrible Doesn't let add pictures and ,And on top of that every posting requires re verification through email even to re post postings on a verified account I have on which through computer it asks for nothing When trying to add a picture to the posting the add picture links are frayed out so you can't click to upload photos Terrible all around

99_120148_2,8,Bummed cant share folders,It allows me to share individual photos but not entire folders What good is that I can easily text someone a single photo WTH I want to be able to send a link to people of an entire folder with many pics in it from my mobile Seems useless now On the other hand I do like that I can view and share excel documents That's pretty cool Although it does take quite a while to load it seems
99_120149_2,8,Hard to navigate,You can't scroll very well when your trying to find a hotel there's no search function that would find the hotel I was staying at and the attractions around and close by When scrolling the hotels you would get to the bottom but it would let go on the the next 20 until you tap on a hotel then you could scroll down to the next 20 It has some good photos of every thing when you find it it doesn't perform well on my iPad it's slow and it hard find what information your looking for if I was to use to book a hotel it might be worth it
99_120150_2,8,No more options for styling as paragraph or section ,I can't believe you guys removed one of the most useful features of Evernote which was the ability to style lines as either a section subsection paragraph or blockquote That was the only way we could give some hierarchy to our notes Now all my notes are one dimensional and its impossible to organize my thoughts How could the Evernote team consider that this feature was unnecessary Do you guys not use your own app How am I supposed to outline my notes This is really a big let down to an otherwise great update But it's too big an omission for me too be happy about anything else That's why I give it 2 stars
99_120151_2,4,Really Bad Transfer,I just tested this app out so that I could view Horrible Bosses as an UltraViolet Digital Copy and I noticed that the movie was hard to see in some places because of what looked like really bad blurry areas right after the logos This happened throughout the movie This never happened to me with the regular digital copies that were compatible with iTunes I could see everything clearly when I was using the regular digital copies I think that if I have to buy these combo packs with UltraViolet Digital Copy I will never use this app again I'll stick to the UltraViolet Flixster cloud because there it wasn't blurry at all On top of this since the update ALL the UltraViolet movies are buffering and skipping This never happened with my last update Please fix 
99_120152_2,12,Keeps freezing,The app used to work great but now it keeps freezing and I can't get into my notes It is very frustrating I have to delete the app and download it again What a pain 
99_120153_2,4,Great app when it works,Freezing on start up all the time Becomes useless Considering other apps
99_120154_2,4,Way too many hang ups ,Hangs up multiple points in interface Way too buggy to be useable 
99_120155_2,16,Keeps getting better still a little buggy,Im on an original iPad mini and so maybe that's part of he deal but it seems like there are still little thins that need some work For example the spell check doesn't work just right and the search is slow at times Neither of these or any others will keep from giving this app a great rating I also think that here are improvements I hope to see in the future One is full screen mode Maybe I'm missing this but the only time you get full screen is when you start a new note I'd like this options when reading or editing too Keep up the good work 
99_120156_2,4,Horrible,The Evernote desktop version effectively ruined my windows 7 computer and brought to a halt my MS Office especially outlook Still trying to repair the effects of this program Sadly haven't even got to really use the program If you use a Mac then maybe no issues but it was a bad purchase for this windows computer user
99_120157_2,4,Crashes ,This app keeps crashing as its loading my document Im a student in college using my iPad and this is not very good considering this is my book file

99_120171_2,8,Scanner,It's great when it works the app disconnects frequently 
99_120172_2,12,Please patch for future updates,In a previous version if the user was looking at pictures and suspended the app it would leave it right where they were upon restarting the app Now the app completely refreshes at start up which gets annoying sometimes Also its more cumbersome to swipe through images since it's only responsive on the top half of the screen instead of the whole screen
99_120173_2,20,problem discovery,Fix some prblms
99_120174_2,8,problem discovery,Full stars if completely downloaded Not downloading properly although full netwrk excess
99_120175_2,16,Crashes when I select INFO ,This is a very beautiful app and worthy of ever cent The only thing is my app crashes every time I try to select for info for a planet Maybe it is because the brand new iOS 4 NEEDS AN UPDATE

99_120180_2,20,Great app for finding local gems,We really enjoy this app while traveling When you're on the road and you're ready to stop to eat this is a great app to find a good place We have found some really good places to eat that we would not have known about Having a map to get you there also helps One small issue I have is that when you ask what's near you or when you use a filter not everything shows up An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel It didn't show up on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location it didn't show up in the search But when I searched by name there was the pub and reviews

99_120188_2,4,DO NOT BUY,I bought this app and the entire workout set for 60 The app did not work correctly so I deleted it and re installed it Now it wants me to pay another 60 to re download the workouts I have contacted the manufacturer twice and have not responded to my emails

99_120203_2,16,problem discovery,Needs a little improvement Overall the app is great It would be nice if you could pin posts to your page from the app Otherwise you CANNOT do it at all if you are mobile Fix it and you will have five stars 
99_120204_2,4,Please clear the un starred files,Non starred files occupied more than 600 MB and I have no way to reduce itit eats out all my ipad space
99_120205_2,12,Better but still needs work,I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version The in game display is better organized and the Scores page is vastly superior to the prior version you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list After a modest amount of use the app appears much more stable However it still needs work in many respects The scoring summary is gone so far as I can tell I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play by play The team leaders appears limited to only 1 QB passing 1 player rushing and 2 receivers with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing Especially during the preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages this is very frustrating there's no way for example to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time A more egregious problem is that at
99_120206_2,20,Great software despite the new web interface,I love Evernote and I use it everywhere and on various devices iOS and desktop I used to love the simplicity of the web interface but the new one seems too cumbersome and I've had some really weird issues where it has overwritten my notes Overall I would rate the environment 45
99_120207_2,4,TripAdvisor Censors,I have tried to get information on TA and all I see is this statement that the review has been removed What gives At this rate TA is of no use to me
99_120208_2,4,Dropbox app now useless,Can no longer add files directly from phone Completely loses point for me now Won't use it until I see an update
99_120209_2,8,Bug is latest ver,Evernote has been a mainstay in my life for the past years and it pains me to say that there's a major bug in current ver Once I get into webview I'm unable to go back to Evernote The Done button is not working I tried quoting the app and it won't work either Now I'm re downloading the app cross fingers this will help
99_120210_2,20,Awesome,I am totally addicted to this this is my only app that I have from so long ago only one tiny problem it does freeze but only once in a blue moon so it doesnt really bother me 1 best app I am up to level 101 NO JOKE 
99_120211_2,12,Fix this issue please,Was I the only one to ever report this problem Ever since I downloaded the latest update the app on my iPad continues to show a pop up alert message I click ok and it pops right back up I've turned off all alerts for the app and I have been in contact with Apple Support We reset to complete default mode reloaded the app and still the issue It is so annoying Is any else experiencing this 
99_120212_2,4,not liking this app anymore,I loved SoundHound before the last update Now I can't view my history I've tried several times and after 30 minutes of waiting for it to download I just give up Back to using Shazam I hope this gets fixed 
99_120213_2,16,Slow and buggy,Please fix the crashes bugs and if its possible make the App faster
99_120214_2,4,Usually very reliable,Until the last update Please fix
99_120215_2,16,problem discovery,Good This app can be improved if there was a option to select it as a default camera 
99_120216_2,8,Seat Selection,Every time I try to select a seat it never loads 
99_120217_2,4,Last update down grade,The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders But you are not able to make folders inside folders I wish you could The bad things about the last update Now typing has lag which is very annoying I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard But now i wish it was back up top at least Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard 
99_120218_2,8,problem discovery,Poor Need updates for Android WA so lame in Androids Fix it 
99_120219_2,8,problem discovery,Although I am an avid Pinner this app keeps knocking me out of my Pinning time therefore making my search have to start over Very irritating Also slows down a ton when I open another board besides my own Please fix these problems I want to Pin more

99_120222_2,8,File names illegible,This is not a review of the Dropbox service which is great but of this app which can use a lot of improvements The single most frustrating thing about it is that it displays only a dozen or so characters in a file name Since I have thousands of files some with long and descriptive names it is impossible to find what I'm looking for unless I download the files to the iPad one by one There is no way to resize the file list to make more of the files visible Why not 
99_120223_2,16,Annoyed,I love Dropbox on my Mac and I use it all the time to share files with my photography clients However I find it very annoying I cannot email the link to my clients in the iPhone app Makes it hard for on the go sharing What's the point of the app if I cannot share my folders Please change 
99_120224_2,4,Send to Dropbox option no longer available in Apps,What happened I used to rely on Dropbox to transfer files from my iPad to my computer The camera upload still works but that's about it They need to fix this App

99_120229_2,4,Used to work ,I'm very disappointed with this app I loved when it worked but since the new update it won't even open That last update was at the end of October and now it's the beginning of December one would think that a big company with I'm sure a nicely paid Tech team would have figured out the bugs by now Don't waste your money on this app until they fix it 
99_120230_2,8,Useless now,I like the app but suddenly it won't open and I can't get to my notes

99_120263_2,20,Wonderful,I use this app traveling through six countries in Europe over a period of three weeks and it was flawless The off line option always worked great Do not expect this map to give you distances from place to place it will not do that But once you get into a city if you want to get around this cannot be beat

99_120276_2,16,Very good app,Does everything I would need a simple weather app to do Radar is slow to load but I have another app for that There's not a lot of detail in the information particularly in details for upcoming days The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day Nevertheless this isn't meant to be too detailed and it provides plenty of info for the current time My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often Sometimes it will load the second time sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation It's a nice looking app the kind that you would want to have on your iPad it just has a stability problem 
99_120277_2,12,There is no way to move edited photos to iPhoto on Mac ,After you edit the photos on the iPad there is no way to move them to the iPhoto app on a Mac They don't update on the Mac Please fix this

99_120282_2,4,Went from great to unusable,This once great app is now useless Every address I enter fails I was a faithful and constant user before the update now I am searching for another app that actually works 
99_120283_2,4,Where's My SkyCaddie ,I have the paid 20 00 version Worked great until update Seriously nothing works now Greens are not tee boxes and swimming pools are not greens 
99_120284_2,4,brown rice,Will definitely download and re rate as 5 stars when this is fixed Unusable if you want that option which is why I give 1 star Dont bother putting brown rice in the special secrion as it may be missed Great way to order and avoid any miscommunication with staff Love the food a ton 
99_120285_2,4,App won't open,I downloaded this app so I could load my physical card and take advantage of the 10 free offer but the app won't open I've rebooted my phone and deleted and reinstalled the app No luck Was there any quality control on this thing 
99_120286_2,8,Recent update crashes,This app was great until the most recent update Now it crashes all the time Do NOT download until this problem is hopefully fixed 
99_120287_2,20,Cool,It is the best app ever 
99_120288_2,4,wow way to kill a potentially great app ,First off let me say that it looks great if I could get it to stay up for more than 5 seconds then it CRASHES The concept is wonderful and the app appears to be very nicely done from a user interface standpoint but it is very unstable Big disappointment since I use this for my doctoral studies major failure in the mobility and convenience categories 0 out of 10 for usefulness 
99_120289_2,12,Opted out,I was using the app which seemed great until I noticed it was posting to my fb page even though I opted out Deleted app because it doesn't give you the option again after the fact
99_120290_2,8,Fix this app,Every time I use it it crashes If I don't use for 25 days pinger says they will give away my number Terrible app 
99_120291_2,12,Freezes during payment processing,The app is fine but the one thing and really only thing you need it for isn't working I attempted to pay a bill using the credit card already on file and after several minutes of beach ball froze the app I had to go to the website to pay my bill 
99_120292_2,4,Great app but constantly freezes,This is just do frustrating Only solution is Delete and re download app Then it freezes again on camera launch Happened for the last month Please fix it then I will Gladly give all Five stars 
99_120293_2,12,Fun game but errors,Very fun but the server is apparently not that big for all users My app keeps getting errors when I try to open it and play where I don't get that with other games Haven't been able to play all day
99_120294_2,4,Game won't load ,Very aggravating First game wouldn't load just got loading spinner Now game will load for 1 play then when you try to play again black screen loading spinner Waste of money Please fix it 
99_120295_2,4,Horrible update,Ever since iOS 7 update Dropbox has not worked constantly crashes when it does run it is EXTREMELY slow and there are problems with camera uploading PLEASE FIX ASAP
99_120296_2,12,Dropbox not working,Since the update it won't backup to Dropbox
99_120297_2,4,Why not support previous IOS ,I have an ipad 1st gen which can not update anymore I want to install dropbox on that device but dropbox can not be installed I hate it Why not support the previous IOS version How can we use it 
99_120298_2,4,Crash,My iPad works fine when I open Dropbox But every time I open it on my iPhone 4 is either crashes or it continuously pulls up a messiah making it hard to close It needs to fixed Fast Even after the current update just a day ago it is still crashing on IPhone This needs to be fixed
99_120299_2,4,Bugs ,I care more about the functionality than the looks so this review will say nothing about the updated look There are some major bugsproblems with the update I am no longer given the option to 'open in' This means I can look at my Numbers spreadsheets but I can't 'open in' Numbers so I can't work with those spreadsheets or enter any info on them Major issue It makes dropbox completely useless for me Please fix this 
99_120300_2,4,Bring back colored icons,This update makes it harder and slower to use The icons for different file types all look very similar which makes it slower to scan through and find the desired file The old version used colors which made it much faster to use
99_120301_2,4,whiteout horrid on iPad,The inverted colors of the icon induce retinal after images and in app the whiteout is hard on the eyes The experience on an iPad Air is one of huge expanses of white or badly contrasting off whitelight blue and stencil thin pale icons battling the brightness of it all The spartan look works fine on an iPhone where there is proportionately less white assaulting the eye with the iPad however I keep trying to reduce the brightness of the display but that only further impacts contrast and legibility Also why is it not possible to change names of files or folders 
99_120302_2,4,Can't open JPEG with new update,Since they did a new update almost all my JPEG take too much time to open or even don't open I need to save the file to see the photo on my iPhone How can I have the old version 
99_120303_2,8,Maximization,HOW CAN I CAN MAXIMIZE THE SLIDE SHOW IT DISAPPEARED BAD UPDATE
99_120304_2,4,Doesn't work on iPad,When I open it crashes my iPad
99_120305_2,8,Downloads of favorites can't resume ,Im on a crappy hotel wifi that goes in and out Been trying to download a 1gb file for over 2 days now But for some reason dropbox has not allowed favorited downloads the ability to resume and instead restarts the download from the beginning every time it fails It's almost 2014 We have the technology to RESUME A DOWNLOAD what's the problem here 
99_120306_2,12,Fix the starred items feature ,It does a poor job at retaining the starred items in memory So I wait a long time for an MP3 to buffer I 'star' it so I won't have to wait next time But then next time it often has to buffer all over again 
99_120307_2,4,Ok,Needs to be less crazy
99_120308_2,8,Could be better,Music takes 15 seconds to load after you have selected a song doesn't matter if I'm on Verizon LTE or Wifi also it doesn't play the next song automatically instead you have to open the app go back and pick the next song in the folder You can't even hit the 'next' button to skip tracks Please fix these in the next update Running iOS7 Same issues on iOS 6
99_120309_2,4,It's stupid,You can't download any videos into your phone Like come on I don't know why yahoo would do this to me making a deal with Dropbox
99_120310_2,8,iPad app crashes,I typically don't leave support as my feedback but I can't seem to get a response This app crashes each and every time I try to open it on my iPad 3rd gen I use it often on my Iph5 but for some reason here it doesn't work Please update ASAP so it works again
99_120311_2,8,Not universal,It works on a few platforms but I love to keep changing my phones every couple of weeks and this app is not universal on all platforms They need to release this app on more platforms like newer Windows Phone 8 like Lumia 1020 and then it will be true 5 stars Till then sky drive wins
99_120312_2,16,Great app Beware of newest version,Always loved Dropbox Reliable and handy Newest version has menu problems Can't upload Please fix Thanks 
99_120313_2,12,Please fix,I'm having issues with moving my files

99_120315_2,4,Can't use,I have not been able to use Please fix
99_120316_2,8,Don't update,New update doesn't detail what's changed Now the app doesn't work Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom Please fix soon
99_120317_2,4,Doesn't work on iPad mini,I get a pop up about push notifications and if I push ok it pops back up again making it completely inoperable I tried changing all the push notification options and it doesn't fix it 
99_120318_2,4,App fails to install can't update either,This app never installed correctly I don't see the icon Nevertheless it always show up in the App Store under Updates It always says Installing I can't update it can't delete it can't use it Only App I've ever seen that does that ZERO stars What a Joke 
99_120319_2,4,Frozen Screen,Spent many hours successfully transporting pictures Site then froze when I needed to export All pictures are locked and frozen I keep trying to re access the app site with no success
99_120320_2,12,need to fix ,somethings wrong with the last update i only can view pdfs once after opening for the first time cannot view them anymore the latest update fixed the issue of crashes and also can view the pdfs without problem thanks a lot for your work however there is still a problem which is that when you try using the 'open in' option in other iPad applications and ask to open in Dropbox the filed just opened shows up in the iPad Dropbox application but the Dropbox server is not updated meaning that file is not found in the Dropbox folders if you access the folders in a different devicecomputer etc
99_120321_2,4,App is missing,Downloaded the latest update and now my app has disappeared and the App Store won't let me download it again
99_120322_2,4,It keeps sayin updating,I can't open the goddamn app
99_120323_2,4,Crashing Help ,I can't open it on my ipad 3 Help Crash Crash Crash 
99_120324_2,4,App Crashes,Thanks Dropbox Here I was thinking Dropbox is one of the greatest inventions since sliced bread One update and I can't access my files or photos on my gen 3 IPad I know it is Presidents' Day weekend but can someone fix this please Maybe you are enjoying time with familysure would be nice to share pics with them
99_120325_2,4,Rubbish,Cannot open any saved files
99_120326_2,4,nightmare,The automatic upload feature is ridiculous as there is no intuitive or easy way to stop it Also the delete function is confusing and should have some sort of dialog box informing you that you are about to delete a photo on your ipad not just in dropbox interface and ask you to confirm that you want to do this My wife tried to stop the automatic upload and hit the delete prompt thinking that may stop it We now lost photos of our newborn which we cannot recover Thank you Dropbox you just lost us photos we will never get back 
99_120327_2,8,App Fails on 411KB upload,The latest revision as of 10 January 2013 loops endlessly when trying to upload a 411KB file Had to email it to move to another device
99_120328_2,12,Reconsidering,Update EN performance has improved considerably from 2 to 3 stars since my last review however the app remains pretty buggy It constantly reports failure to synch it freezes momentarily between all actions it crashes here and thee and the search function sometimes fails to find key words I am borderline thinking of going premium but also keeping an eye for alternatives Note some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7 Previous review After several months of daily use and building about 1K pretty intensive notes I was in the process to put a serious long term commitment to EN but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week in terms of less freezes
99_120329_2,4,Dec 12 Update Crashes App,I love Evernote and have become very reliant on it one of the apps I can't do without however I am without it now because it crashes on open and will not open on iPhone DO NOT load the Dec 12 update Evernote please fix
99_120330_2,4,Freezes,The app has been unbelievably buggy since the last update Cannot trust using it on iPhone only desktop and iPad 
99_120331_2,4,EverCrash,Brilliant app but crashes on iPad and iPhone
99_120332_2,8,Dislike this update ,I dislike the latest version My notes randomly disappear They are listed under the wrong name usually by the one that is actually above it I LOVED the version prior to this one This version is making me lose my confidence that my notes are actually being saved 
99_120333_2,8,Progressively pretty functionally worse,Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I'm happy to be a premium subscriber The mobile app however seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements ' which are essentially ads now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work I'd subscribe I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration though this feature causes a crash Arg I'm an Evernote evangelist but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app ORIGINAL REVIEW Thanks for your hard work Happy to be a premium subscriber Only suggestion add ability to copy note links
99_120334_2,4,Can't trust it,I really wanted a note system I could trust but Evernote just lost all my notes on the upgrade
99_120335_2,4,Very poor design,It seems Evernote did not understand the spirit of iOS 7 The design seems flat for the sake of flatness Usability has been thrown out the door It's very confusing to use the app Simple actions are painfully slow
99_120336_2,8,I give up,Okay Evernote I hope you are listening You had a great idea But 'note' should not be in your name Call it Eversomething The text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text bullets numbered lists indentation etc Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting I don't know but until this is fixed it is not useful And man I've really tried to like Evernote The synching ability among so many platforms was great But I have to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you will read this But I really wish you would understand this huge weakness in your product And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities Please fix this I really want need a proper Evernote 
99_120337_2,12,Needs fixing,The search function isn't working and I have to sign in every time I open it Evernote needs to fix this Other than that I love Evernote
99_120338_2,4,Oops,Was just beginning to trust this app until 7 update Quit working for all practical purposes Will watch for patches and post an updated review I really was wanting this app to be effective They have some silly new process to sell post it notes Not 
99_120339_2,16,iOS 7 glitches, The highlighting of words works but the menu that pops up to copy cut paste etc Won't stay open long enough to be used When placing the cursor over text when the keyboard is open makes the text jump every where but where you want the cursor to be
99_120340_2,4,BROKEN,No notes showing up All the notebooks are there but they are all empty Boo
99_120341_2,12,Lovehate,Seems like the Evernote religion has passed me by Perhaps there are handy tools that I am missing trainings that are obvious to all but me But really The notes bullet points spacing numbering all fail when i transfer to Word and other systems The resulting formatting problems take longer than just starting over and retyping notes I also find that the left column flickers and the program crashes at every other use About 1 in 4 syncs give an error message All that aside I like calling up notes on my phone ipad and desktop almost whenever I want If this problematic version is intended to induce me to go for another version it doesn't In fact if this version were more solid I'd be tempted to buy the upgrade
99_120342_2,8,Problems syncing and opening notes,When this app worked I'd give it 4 stars But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync And then I couldn't open all my notes And now it says trouble reaching evernote server Btw the solution to that 1 after I tried reinstalling and rebooting is to log in using user name instead of email or vice versa Whatever you're having a problem w try the other But annoying this happens at all If it works for you this is a pretty good app to help you keep all those notes you scribble down and email yourself in 1 place
99_120343_2,4,HORRIBLE UPDATE ,Today's update dated March 1 2013 is horrible Every single time I open up the App it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then when I select either 'Title' which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes in alphabetical order or I select 'Created ' the App immediately crashes and closes I have tried this over 50 times I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail I tried deleting the App all together and then reloaded it but still the same problem This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created and even each month is not in alphabetical order THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE I have always been one of your biggest advocates and proponents If this bug isn't fixed pronto I will have to delete Evernote permanently and use a different App ARGHHHHHH 
99_120344_2,16,Saved button is missing,I was looking for the longest time the save Favorites feature button until I noticed that it only appears when iPad is hold in vertical position upright This was so weird I usually hold my iPad for trip advisor in horizontal position sideways so the button was nowhere to be found I hope that the tripadvisor fixes this UX usability issue soon
99_120345_2,4,Was greatnow crashes,Was an excellent app Now crashes on iPod touch since last update Won't open at all Please fix asap 
99_120346_2,4,DO NOT RELY ON TA MAPS,Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong or maybe a mislabeled street but I am seeing much worse locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area Want to golf Go horseback riding Come to the historic Centro where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house Next problem related to this is the 'Near Me' function First the app couldn't find me Instead it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house Lastly the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed I am definitely unhappy with
99_120347_2,4,This Website is a Fraud,Most of the hotel reviews especially from poor hotels are fake and most likely posted by employees Notice how after a negative review is posted it is invariably followed by several glowing reviews And because TripAdvisor is paid by the hotels listed on this site they will remove negative reviews if pressured by the hotel
99_120348_2,12,Please fix bug,I love this app It helps me a lot when I'm on the trip but one thing that makes me mad that when I click to see the photos It's only show 1 pic and I got stuck I have to delete the app and redownload it again 
99_120349_2,8,No Saved Trips,Unable to save forum posts that are the most useful suggestions when out on a trip No Saved Trips that you personally put together to assist you when out about with your mobile What good is that Not many will find a wifi and open their laptop
99_120350_2,8,Map does not refresh after detail view,Then you have to go back to search and zoom in from a global view Buggy
99_120351_2,4,Lag ,Lag Very Laaagggg Please fix it

99_120413_4,4,rating,Rip off What comes basic in most quality editors this app wants us to buy at up to 2 each totalling over 30 00 what a rip off It doesn't even have hue which I use more then any other filter Highly dissatisfied There are hundreds of editors in the play store plus most phones come with one that's fairly decent hit share to find yours Uninstalled

99_120419_4,4,rating,I want my money back The one thing I hate about it always doesn't work it works when it wants to apps should be 99 cents instead of three dollars I don't think it's worth 3 I recommend you do not buy it unless you have money to waste 
99_120420_4,4,rating,a a
99_120421_4,4,rating,Good Good aps
99_120422_4,4,rating,Costs too much and too many add ons Despite its many options I've had experienced many issues with this product It has crashed quite a few times already in the last two days moreover why do I have to pay so much for 'add ons' that should be standard such as fonts and dictionary This just shows the developer is being too greedy In addition it seems to be very slow on my nexus 10
99_120423_4,4,rating,Abysmal controls and AI repetitive campaign Fun game abysmal controls and AI Why on earth team 17 opted for touch controls instead of virtual arrows or a d pad I have no idea Now the AI uses grenades or bazooka about 90 percent of the time with absolute perfection Calculating wind speeds and never missing a single shot even if it is necessary to shoot in the complete opposite direction and rely solely on wind Please make it more human and make it use the other weapons a lot more often Plus the campaign is just skirmish no actual missions 
99_120424_4,4,rating,Nice I like it
99_120425_4,4,rating,Awkward menus I bought this app quickly attempted to do my most common types of formatting and found it very slowly and fiddly on my note 2 Much better on the BlackBerry So as quickly as I could I attempt to un install and get a refund can't So am I stuck 
99_120426_4,4,rating,AVG Tried and tried and tried to use the AVG find my phone part of this app Didn't find it once just kept saying try later so I did and kept on trying I paid for this app so I kind of expect it to work Not enough to the app either Dull to use looks Dull and had I not paid for it I would delete in a heart beat

99_120430_4,4,rating,Bisso Pp
99_120431_4,4,rating,Not horrible but All in all it's in the tradition of the franchise In campaign mode it's pretty annoying that the AI never misses and the wind is always exactly what it needs to hit 
99_120432_4,4,rating,Ehhh Every level after 19 is ridiculously hard The enemy worms take hardly any damage and seem to aim perfectly through the tiniest spaces while your worms die by 1st or 2nd turn leaving you with 1 worm against 8 or 9 I'm ready to uninstall
99_120433_4,4,rating,Specs fail I noticed the same on my note 2 it says tht i have dual core 
99_120434_4,4,rating,Grt Gud
99_120435_4,4,rating,Android Very nice app
99_120436_4,4,rating,Same old worms terrible controls The developer has opted for the classic tap either side of the screen to move and drag the reticle to aim touch control system it does not support controller or keyboard input The result is a control system that is borderline unresponsive and makes fine movement or fast movement completely inefficient This game is so tedious to play it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it If you bought this during the sale you got a great deal but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17 I'm disappointed in this lackluster port Overall the game is a great example of what can happen to a great idea when it's executed poorly I am however happy to give Team 17 a few extra dollars and hope they make improvements over time 
99_120437_4,4,rating,Money ripping I have played this game on pc and realised it was released for android platform As soon as i downloaded it and payed for it it is ridiculous that they are still charging so much money for other mini games available in the game Really disappointed with this Please resolve this issue n i'll give this game a 5 star

99_120454_4,4,rating,There was a time for this app The fact that the app needs me to register after I have paid for it sucks The fact that it makes me do it with no way of turning it off other than hitting later every time it updates is a deal breaker Get a 365 account and use Microsoft's full version of office

99_120569_4,8,rating,Pretty Good I give it three stars because there's alot of photo editing apps that already have the same features for free you'll get that fifth star whenever the clone effect is added but it's pretty good but no better than the FREE apps with these same effects 
99_120570_4,8,rating,Ghh
99_120571_4,8,rating,Lots of fun Wish the hair edit wasn't so vibrant And the lower half of face doesn't get much change when brightening the face 
99_120572_4,8,rating,Good stuff This app would be better if the draw function had the same beautiful brushes as Line Brush However the eyedropper tool ability to change opacity and hardness of brush tools and more make this photo editing app a good one I haven't updated however after reading the latest reviews

99_120605_4,8,rating,The best one suggestion I'd love to see an option for TRUE black and white saves not just an option for high contrast greyscale That way CCITT compression could be used and the space saving would be dramatic 90 percent of my scans would be fine in high rez 1 bit I've yet to see another app that can save to 1 bit though they can be read by most PDF viewers but given storage size concerns I don't see why scan apps don't include this as an option Great job on all the rest though

99_120802_4,10,rating,Like Awesome
99_120803_4,10,rating,Great app easy to use This app has completely surpassed my expectations It is extremely easy to use has a nice interface and let's you produce a wide variety of collages 
99_120804_4,10,Great Fun,This game is really fun and a great way to learn facts geography capitals landmarks and locations of all of the great states in the United States My nephews are into strategically placing the stacks Super learning fun 
99_120805_4,6,Awesome ,I love how it tests my brain 
99_120806_4,10,Worth every penny ,You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free I thought the same thing and finally ponied up do you really spend that much more less on a cup of coffee and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable Time tables are pretty accurate but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab Has saved me so much in time 
99_120807_4,10,Works great,Easy to find songs and purchase in iTunes 
99_120808_4,10,Awesome app,Having fun I never had much interest in astronomy but this app has changed everything 
99_120809_4,10,Great app ,Lots of fun to use We live in a unpopulated area and it's neat to pick out which stars are what The app works very well 
99_120810_4,8,Revue,It's really useful cuz I'm a astronomer It's magestical 
99_120811_4,10,Awesome,A very exciting app I like to share with my kids 
99_120812_4,10,Saweeeet',Very nice app
99_120813_4,10,Local Eats,Great info on Houston restaurants though some restaurant info needs to be updated such as those which have relocated 
99_120814_4,8,The best restaurant finding app,The only complaint I have about this app is that unless you live in one of the supported cities it's pretty much useless Even if you do live in a big city the app won't help you at all if you're travelling somewhere smaller which is why I recommend keeping a backup app like Urbanspoon on your iPhone as a backup 
99_120815_4,10,Nice program quick support ,I bought this app on December 24th I purchased mainly for hunting and the Google terrain map set I had issued where the terrain map would not load and was blacked out All other maps and features worked fine I emailed customer support that night around 11pm and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am Christmas morning Now that's what I would consider excellent support Seems there was a small issue with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd and Saturday the 24th I am all fixed up now and everything works great 
99_120816_4,10,Great app super useful,I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time I strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app 
99_120817_4,10,Wow what a great update ,I cannot believe how amazing the new changes are If you mountain bike hike camp or travel this is a must need app It now tracks altitude pace speed and about every other stat you need in any unit of measure By far this is the best app I have 
99_120818_4,10,Good app,Pretty easy to use been using it for over 2 years Easy to learn As new features were added those features made sense 
99_120819_4,10,Love love love ,This is hands down the most useful app I had the lite version but decided it was worth the money to upgrade It makes it so much easier than the guess and check on the calendar I love it 
99_120820_4,8,Photographer,Ran side by side with other and this app beat all hands down Needs dedicated space for mileage 
99_120821_4,8,Great app,Love it's multifunctionality Able to do multiple business and year prior expenses etc 
99_120822_4,8,Consumer,This ap is great really puts your collection at your fingertips I really like how easy it is to manage your wine collection buying drinking or storage notes Love it 
99_120823_4,10,Great app ,Works awesome for me Have 1200 cellar of mostly older bottles Scan works a lot but type and search fills in Really live off this app love the drink now feature Use that every week 
99_120824_4,10,The best,Better than any other wine app 
99_120825_4,8,Ehh,It is a good app but I eat a lot of home cooked meals and it's hard to find the exact thing I ate 
99_120826_4,10,Amazing,This app is beast The best thing is is that it doesn't need Internet Because I have an iPod touch so I don't have Internet on it in public I recomend this app 
99_120827_4,10,Great app,Buy it
99_120828_4,8,I like,This is a great little app especially for those with hectic schedules it keeps you in like for visual people like me 
99_120829_4,6,Support my touch ,Live sky does not work on my touch Also doesn't find my correct locAtion So close to being like the Droid app but off by a parsec

99_120929_4,10,Too too cool ,My only complaint with this otherwise wonderful app is the absence of any warning for the bottomless hole in time this thing hides If you are not very careful you will fall into this hole which isn't marked in any fashion by a navigation tool that marks everything else and your family or friends may lose you Leave a note and tell them where you went and don't worry you'll meet thousands of new friends down in that hole Finally I wrote chatted with the guy who wrote this good man and thanks for this jewel

99_121008_4,10,Please check you're haha grammar spelling hahaha I use this app everyday When we can I shield,The word and we listen to the word of the day and see if we know the meaning or something very close to it We find it to be an entertaining 'game' Sorry The first part of my review is in the title segment Bummer But CHEERS 5 STARS THE BEST RATING 10 stars no 11 Bbwwahahahahaha

99_121010_4,8,Super Useful,Great App to have around No more need to carry a Dictionary or Thesaurus 
99_121011_4,8,Semi awesome,Reader works great though editing on some books is off enough to be distracting Like the user interface and quick loading Still struggling to figure out how to download or find other books as selection is rather limited 
99_121012_4,8,Much Improved,I like the new features that make the product more Stanza like I still would like to be able to go directly from the library list to the current place in any given book without having to pass by the TOC page 
99_121013_4,10,Great app ,Love this app because it helps me keep my finances in order Easy to use 
99_121014_4,10,Best App Ever ,I have already submitted a review when I first downloaded stating That this App is the best Well yesterday it proved itself I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital I just emailed myself my list printed it and was able to give it to doctor Even the Nurses and Doctors were impressed There is one thing however that I think would make this App even better Add a COMMENT Area so you can write comments regarding yourself or the medications or whatever

99_121017_4,10,Infinity blade,Graphics are very nice The game play is amazing a lot of quick thinking Plus you get to upgrade constantly The one thing that bugs me is how short the game is and the way it repeats itself That being said I won't get tired of playing for a while

99_121029_4,10,My flash solution,I use skritter for learning Japanese and it's an application that requires flash however I mainly study on my iPhone and probably wouldn't keep up with the SRS if I was only able to access the program on my computer Thanks to splashtop now I can practice on the go that sounds like a infomercial lol

99_121056_4,10,Owner,Great app 
99_121057_4,8,Backcountryelkhunter,Works great Maps are good better than my Garmin Default is the lowest cache amount so make sure you turn up the cache amount so you don't find yourself without any maps when you lose service Make sure you scout your area with the maps you want before hunting so it will cache your map area for when you lose service you still can use your cached maps Best 5 bucks spent for those who want a good hunting GPS

99_121059_4,10,One of the best iOS apps just got better ,The new release shows what a mature iOS app should look like It performs incredibly well while offering most features if not all that users could want Not only is it now offered at a lower price but there is an option to enhance the application with an upgrade Since few users need the enhancements it is a great way to offer them

99_121078_4,10,Instagram,Awesome 
99_121079_4,10,Great App Gets Better ,This is a great app I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2 Each version is more refined I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version currently 'The Message' when I tap on the Scripture for the day This isn't the case with the iPhone app One always has to change the version from the default There are a couple formatting issue suggestions 1 The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row 2 One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner but there is no way to enlarge it One would think that a simple double tap could bring up the cover art full screen 3 When traveling I don't always have a wifi link so having issues cached is nice In those instances I simply use my Bible app or print version to get the Scripture for the d
99_121080_4,8,Very useful,I have used this on countless occasions now It has come in handy and when I do use it the other party is as wowd as I was the first time I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky may be iPhone speech recognitions problems and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny But if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time Overall very pleased with this for just a buck 
99_121081_4,10,Amazing Must Have App,I am truly amazed at how well this app works the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that when I am recording my voice for translation IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS ME I have a very deep voice and I have never had any type of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the correct version I am very very very pleased with this app you should get it 
99_121082_4,8,Nice,The adjustments in Snapseed are very good and it's simple to learn and use However I'm not a fan The tools are very specific purpose and I find myself constantly moving back and forth from one limited purpose tool to another If you like a good sample of adjustments presented at one time in one place and on screen at all times Snapseed may not be what you're looking for 
99_121083_4,10,Awesome ,Best Post Edit App that I've tried to date Advanced features rival and even exceed that of Camera which I also love I did grab this free during a promo but even at 4 99 this ones worth the splurge

99_121121_4,10,Excellent App,Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet The reports are great Would love to be able to have main categories and sub categories That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand alone financial management app Keep up the good work 
99_121122_4,10,Great ,But make more apps People apple does not allow to open all apps directly only if the developer of app make it in code The launch of apps without safari is not possible An some apps possible but still not faster

99_121134_4,8,It works idiots ,Ok people this app works and if you are too stupid to figure out how to make something so simple work you shouldn't own a smart phone especially the iPhone The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the addition of all the contacts Looking forward to future updates 
99_121135_4,10,I can't believe this works so well,I never have to take a foreign language class again 
99_121136_4,8,ITranslator 1 0,Itranslater 1 0 is a good app but sometimes it dose't work out as you plan it to that is why I only rate it 4 stars rather than 5

99_121151_4,8,Well ,I love this app Its so easy to learn how to use it and its very easy to understand The only thing I don't like is that if you choose the option to show what the temp feels like you can't see what the temp actually is I would love to be able to see both at the same time

99_121177_4,10,Incredibly helpful ,This app is so fantastic I actually find it even better than the website It is easy to navigate easy to modify reservations There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar You can invite your co diners easily through the app it creates an email for you A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only by neighborhoods within a city by distance to you and so much more I use this app on a regular basis so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there It's such a great app and business that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it

99_121343_4,10,Accurate,Accurate
99_121344_4,4,Didn't work consistently,Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4 I was able to get it to work three times And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate as the dial moves around and then restarts constantly Sometimes a blinking heart shows up The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85 and then 31 Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs same spot It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app Seems to work for some people and not for others Doesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting

99_121453_4,8,I want to know how many targets I have hit so far ,I love the Brave version better than the original The graphics are much better and I love the phrases she says The objective of hitting 100 is stupid when I don't know how I've done if I have improved or not when a status on targets hit is not given Tally it up in a drop down much like the distance markers at the end of each target segment

99_121465_4,10,Awesome ,
99_121466_4,4,Great game messed up with payments,This is a finely crafted bubble shooter with great graphics cute characters and fun gameplay that merits 4 or 5 stars HOWEVER that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in game payments of this sort I HATE this type of payment system I would much rather buy the game up front for 1 2 or even 3 If that option becomes available I would definitely buy this game 
99_121467_4,10,Nice,Good job

99_121553_4,2,lost my notes ,this used to be a good appproduct important notes i took are gone can't recommend until they fix these major bugs 
99_121554_4,2,A case study in how to ruin a product,I am so disappointed to see the turn that the ios app has taken There's so much to dislike about this craptastic abomination that I'm not even going to try I'm a long time premium user and am seriously considering other options
99_121555_4,2,User unfriendly,Hard to use takes up big chunks of the screen trying to sell me crap
99_121556_4,10,Highly recommended,It's a app that you can do pretty much everything from making to do list to office papers It's great for people that are on the go and can store almost anything and have it in the palm of their hand
99_121557_4,2,Used to work,But not anymore iOS 7 seems to be incompatible Too bad so sad uninstall
99_121558_4,2,Needs a lot of work,Horrible
99_121559_4,10,Stop complaining ,Evernote is awesome That's all
99_121560_4,10,Love Evernote,I use it all the time and it works great 
99_121561_4,10,My favorite app,Great app after 5 years of using it I upgraded to premium Very well done
99_121562_4,10,I love my Evernote ,I love this thing seriously I use it for everything from project tracking to grocery lists to personal archive Can't recommend it highly enough That said I've got iOS7 on my phone but have not upgraded my iPad waiting for Apple to work some of the bugs out of the new OS for us tablet users As a result synching between devices is not always reliable right now just a watch out
99_121563_4,10,Love the iOS 7 update,Feels more fluid controls are intuitive and exactly where I expect them to be Design meshes perfectly with iOS 7 Great job on this update 
99_121564_4,2,Wrong minimum iOS ,Evernote is no longer usable to me because I have not jumped on the iOS7 bandwagon I never adopt a new OS until the kinks have been wrung out Now I have lost the use of Evernote and I used to use it a lot Bad call Now I will be looking for something else to use and will let my Premium subscription expire
99_121565_4,10,I like evernote,Use Evernote a lot thanks
99_121566_4,8,Great app and service but update is ugly,The last version had a 'wow ' factor to it this version is ugly IMHO Still like what it does for me though
99_121567_4,10,Best app on my phone,Most folks who are trashing this version need to chill A reinstall fixes nearly all the issues I've been using EN for work travel and home I have been able to use it for travel the family went to Rome and I loaded all the maps and travel info reservations hotel info geocaches etc It saved time and trouble Now I add all my receipts and get rid of the paper This really has made tax preparation easier My favorit app I don't know what I would do without it
99_121568_4,2,Doesn't Support IOS6,You've got to be kidding I'm an Evernote premium user but NEVER update my iOS on the first go round If I had known I would not have updated Evernote Crap I use EN for everything 
99_121569_4,10,Love it,I use it all the time works great
99_121570_4,10,Best,Evernote is the best note taking and keeping appservice there is As a long time user I know that they make it their business to offer more and better and safer features than anyone else
99_121571_4,10,Why did I not find this 3 years ago ,PC laptops droid tablet two iPhones and one set of reference documents on all of them for myself and the wife What the heck was I doing sending copies and updates in msgs and hand written notes I'm so embarrassed I did not find this 3 years ago 
99_121572_4,10,In constant use on all platforms,Performs better than other services that I have tried
99_121573_4,10,I love this app,It's like carrying 40 different notebooks around in your pocket all the time And the fact that all the info and ideas you collect during the day is waiting for you on your desktop computer when you get home is invaluable
99_121574_4,10,Perfect for iOS 7 on 4s,Evernote for iOS 7 is beautiful built for apples latest toys It's the best way to organize documents and images in one place
99_121575_4,10,Evernote rating,No other app does what Evernote does in my experience You just have to start using it and it is very easy You cannot make a mistake or lose your material Once you start using it it will become an essential part of how you save and organize your thoughts material pictures virtually anything It is one of those 'must have' apps
99_121576_4,10,Couldn't live with out it,If
99_121577_4,10,Stop reading and get it ,You won't look back after getting this app Simple as that
99_121578_4,10,I Love It,It is my most important work tool Keep the updates coming
99_121579_4,10,Great App,Evernote is a great application I use it across platforms and it always works without a glitch
99_121580_4,10,Evernotecan't live without it,Since using Evernote I store everything there From to do list to what I ate at a particular restaurant and the wine we had it all goes into Evernote for reference It's nice to know where everything is filed
99_121581_4,10,Love Evernote,Evernote is one of the few apps that I use everyday It's a delight to use for recording ideas and notes
99_121582_4,10,Seriously love this app,My creative juices can flow anytime anywhere and I've got the tool to capture it all

99_121588_4,10,Most frequently used app,I love Evernote and frankly don't know how I'd live without it I have it installed on my desktop iPhone and iPad It's a lifesaver For newbies you might not be sure how to use this app Head to their website and they have user guides which will give you some ideas Once you incorporate it you'll start seeing the value right away
99_121589_4,8,Great app ,I resisted using Evernote for some time while using other applications but decided to give it a try and have not regretted that decision While not perfect the totality of all of the functions makes it the best so far for me
99_121590_4,10,very good,
99_121591_4,10,Favorite App,This is one of my favorite apps 
99_121592_4,2,Can not be removed ,This app will not down load or let me remove it Why 
99_121593_4,10,Awesome,100 great One of my favorite productivity apps

99_122796_5,4,feature request,Very good Need to update voice sometime back ground noise comes Thanks
99_122797_5,5,feature request,Bugged The last update caused the game to stop working It won't even start now Please fix New update still didn't fix anything 
99_122798_5,3,I wish ,It would pull the contacts I have on facebook but not on my phone and put them on my phone 
99_122799_5,3,I Need Backups or Dropbox Back,I've had this app for about a year I love it but can you bring back backups or dropbox so I can transfer files to my laptop Please do this
99_122800_5,1,Okay for chains no good otherwise,Great idea for an app and works okay for gas and chain restaurants but that is literally all you will find No grocery stores cafes or anything that is not fast food or large chains No coffee shops other than Starbucks and no foreign foods and definitely nothing remotely healthy Also lacking an option for submissions I was excited at the possibilities for this app but the reality is much more disappointing 
99_122801_5,5,Fantastic UI but missing a few features,Clear has one of the best designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone iPad It is the way apps should be So simple and easy I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings 1 It would be nice to sync with the desktop iCal and between devices 2 It needs Reminders and Alerts and Due Dates etc 3 Some kind of support for longer notes Right now single tapping an item lets you edit the item Maybe double tapping should let you open an item's detail page where you could enter the due date add an alarm or type a longer note 4 Also sharing a list It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists Though now I admit this is feature creep that could detract from Clear's simplicity 
99_122802_5,2,Not bad,I just wish it would notify me if I go below a certain dollar amount
99_122803_5,1,Oh well ,They should add the function to buy Starbucks gift cards via iTunes store I wonder if they'll add that when iOS6 comes in with passbook 
99_122804_5,4,Please integrate with WW Kitchen,I also like WW Kitchen and often add my own recipes It would be great if the two apps were integrated so if I added a recipe in WW Kitchen I could pull it up in WW Mobile 
99_122805_5,3,Needs,They should add the photo editting option Then this app would be perfect 
99_122806_5,3,Suggestion for Hold Mail,It seems like it would be a great addition to have the hold mail feature from your website here also Please include this in the next release 
99_122807_5,2,Multitasking ,It's almost 2011 Where is the multitasking 
99_122808_5,4,GRADES,Requires access to grades and it'll get 5 strs in my book
99_122809_5,5,Convenient App,Great App Useful and easy to use 
99_122810_5,4,5 6 days please ,3 days won't do I need at least 5 days Seems user friendly and easy to follow Perhaps if it added the ingredients not multiple entries for the some onion per se 
99_122811_5,4,Good but still needs some extra options,It's very convenient to use however not being able to switch between accounts without un linking the phone would be great Also an improvement in the media player would also help
99_122812_5,3,,One feature they should add is being able to import multiple photos to camera roll then it be better
99_122813_5,2,Things Dropbox needs,Would be nice to have a grid view of photos other than just the auto upload of camera roll Also would be nice to rename files My last review still not fixed This app doesn't support mobi file uploads Would be nice to save my mobi files
99_122814_5,4,Like the new design,Is Dropbox design for iOS 7 but is still the same more or less Air Drop is the only new thing in this update for iPhone I think 4 out of 5 because still can't rename files
99_122815_5,4,Great,I just wish you could edit your word documents other than that it's great 
99_122816_5,5,Very usefull app,Thank's for app but can you add offline mod for exmple i want save one video in my iphone and after that play it with VLC
99_122817_5,1,Update please,We should be able to do text documents 
99_122818_5,3,Important,If we could create docs inside the app that would be great
99_122819_5,2,No Gallery,Still no gallery in Camera Upload mode 
99_122820_5,4,Video,Its amazing The only thing to make it better is to have the ability or export videos to your camara roll
99_122821_5,4,Few requests,Hey Dropbox team Please add the ability to rename files as well as the ability for gifs to play I know you can do it 
99_122822_5,3,Downloading ,It's super easy to copy pictures to clipboard or even save them to your phone but why can't I download my videos 
99_122823_5,3,Good UI but lacks features,Beautiful app but NEEDS the ability share folders For people on the go we need to be able to email links out to people sending tons of individual links to people is not feasible
99_122824_5,2,Larger photos,Please include the option to view thumbnail larger while viewing in the photo folder
99_122825_5,5,Print,Would love to be able to print right from the app instead of having to go through the browser or open it in another app Otherwise very convenient
99_122826_5,1,Update is a step backwards ,I've been using Dropbox for quite sometime now I have earned a fair amount of space and I love being able to access all my files from my iPhone iPad MacBook and the Internet via anyone else's computer But these last 2 updates have disabled the save to camera roll feature which I use all the time and have come across several times since the new update Please please please add this feature back I know I can just do a screen shot but i prefer the clean cut copy you receive without boarders from saving images to the camera roll 
99_122827_5,5,Bookmarks and Highlights,I love this app but I do wish I could highlight words in PDFs and create bookmarks Would this be possible at some piont 
99_122828_5,3,Pretty good app but , Why can't I sign into separate Drop Box accounts 
99_122829_5,4,That's Great,You should put the folders first And then the files I would put a folder as favorite thus putting all the files inside this as favorite too
99_122830_5,5,Love but,Can we get push notifications for other things being shared besides just folders My bf is a photographer he often sticks photos in our shared folder would like a notification when things arrive I do have them turned on but never get them 
99_122831_5,4,Well thought out and easy to quickly access,The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful and makes accessing files on the go far more convenient I also think the latest style refresh is a big positive in the right direction I use dropbox on all of my devices I would like to see sorting within the app improved eg by date but it's good otherwise
99_122832_5,3,Needs GIF support ,Please add support for animated GIFs 
99_122833_5,5,Super easy to keep notes organized,I love the app for allowing me to keep my notes organized and synchrd across devices I also love the feature of sharing stuff with mates The only thing I long for is collaboration on notes
99_122834_5,3,Premium with ads What gives ,I have a premium account and I use Evernote for business and personal items all day long and I am very frustrated about the new advertisement section I've been graced with despite paying not to have advertisements Also there is no logic behind the new tag section I really like the the tag section but I want to organize what pops up there I can't find a master list of reminders in the app or the desktop version Maybe I haven't looked hard enough but this seems to be a gaping oversight A calandra would be nifty as well
99_122835_5,3,Good but could be a lot better,The app present good features but there is a lot of bugs and missing some hotkeys to make the writing easier
99_122836_5,4,Great product,I love pasting notes to ever note I paste my passwords I paste copies of receipts and anything that I need to locate later and I can easily find it in one location the search option is very handy as well I WISH THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE CLEARER
99_122837_5,5,Evernote,This is a very useful and helpful app In my opinion the only thing it's missing is video handling You can add pictures and audio to your notes and I think you should be able to add videos too
99_122838_5,5,Great,Does almost everything except allowing me to make a quick diagram by hand But it does allow me to take a pic and record voice so that helps
99_122839_5,5,Now my main note program,This has become my main notes program Wish I could do handwriting on it Love how can I can put outlook emails in it Using more than my other note apps in the iPad
99_122840_5,4,Great organizer,This is really a great app an tool to manage multiple projects and scattered notes I just wish that there was a calendar integration and sub folders within stacks Also in Evernote hello there is no categorizing But make no mistake I swear by this program
99_122841_5,5,Amazing ,Thanks Evernote for a great app I use it DAILY to keep my gluten free dairy free recipes organized A tip Please allow me to search ALL my notebooks helpful to locate an ingredient rather than searching within each notebook individually Also I would love to pay a flat fee to be able to access my notes offline Thanks
99_122842_5,4,Please add scroll bar and useful word search ,I would give this 5 stars if it had these two additional features Ability to use a scroll bar on iPad and iPhone rather than swipe swipe swipe and more swipe to get to the bottom of a note Ability to keyword search AND GO TO THAT KEYWORD like you can on the laptop version Having search feature for a word does me no good if I can't search within the note to find that word Can you do these two things for iOS please 
99_122843_5,4,Almost Perfect,Great information is available Wish maps locations of newer hotels were updated more Also would love to have an individual resort map of all the resorts available to view Would be great if age of property and renovation dates were included for hotels too
99_122844_5,5,Great App,I tend to provide reviews on the fly and my only wish is that I could edit them through the app I also wished that there was a way to respond to replies One hotel accurately described itself on TripAdvisor but was misleading on its website but I can't point this out
99_122845_5,4,Great App wsearching for hotels,This app has been very helpful on my honeymoon search It would be nice to be able to enlarge the photos though Other than that it's perfect
99_122846_5,3,Needs Offline Functionality,Great app beautiful layout But I wish saved items could be viewed offline 
99_122847_5,1,Why force landscape ,Still landscape only So weird Every other app has the ability to go either direction Too bad
99_122848_5,4,I agree with 4,They need to show B B small inns
99_122849_5,3,Landscape support please ,Please add landscape support for your fat fingered users 
99_122850_5,5,feature request,Great application One of the great application for chat Please just increase the upload limit That will be very useful
99_122851_5,2,feature request,Increase participants in a group increase participants in a group Update it
99_122852_5,4,feature request,awesome bt plz increase the size videos that we send
99_122853_5,1,feature request,No Galaxy Gear support Please create an app for Galaxy Gear I can only read the notifications on my Gear I would love to have an option to reply directly from my Gear Thanks
99_122854_5,5,feature request,Hope it had whatsApp to sms though 
99_122855_5,4,feature request,One thing needed You should be able to have sub boards For example You would have the board Food Then on the board food you could have a sub board for dessert Or healthy Our brunch
99_122856_5,4,feature request,I've been addicted forever The only thing I would change is that over time I want it more organized so I make another board I wish there was a 'move pin' button to place it to another board current technique is having to repin then delete it from the old board
99_122857_5,4,feature request,Great Only complaint is being able to change the picture that represents your boards And just a user friendlier way to change settings and customizeadd pictures to your boards
99_122858_5,5,feature request,Perfect Vry gud app for editingplz add some more interesting frame 
99_122859_5,4,feature request,Wonderful but Could be better if all tools built in and not depending upon the network connection
99_122860_5,3,Edited photos not uploaded,Dropbox is a great service However when I use the camera upload option in iOS 7 it only uploads the original photo and not the edited one Otherwise I'd rate dropbox as 5 stars
99_122861_5,2,Still cannot change file names,Still no ability to change file names a very basic function Hard to believe after this amount of time Error messages when simply trying to move files No response from dropbox
99_122862_5,3, Open In option still missing,I hoped the update would bring back the 'open in' option but it didn't Importing files into other apps is a major pain now Why was this option removed Please bring it back
99_122863_5,1,Bad,Very slow uploading and poor background uploading does it really need 3h to upload several megabyte video over 10 Mbit internet 
99_122864_5,1,Sharing,I can't share folders That was the only reason I made a Dropbox in the first place Ugh
99_122865_5,2,Voicememo,How to add voice memo from the iPhone 
99_122866_5,3,Where is the download multiple feature ,This would easily be a 5 star app Best idea ever But it loses 2 stars just because I have to download one photo at a time This is a huge inconvenience
99_122867_5,1,Still no folder refresh Pathetic,Even Google Drive can refresh folders Some simple suggestions to increase usability 1 Currently you have to leave the folder and come back in if you wish to refresh that folder Let me refresh my folder with a refresh button so that I can view changes to files in a more streamlined manner If I am constantly compiling a document on my computer and using my iPad to check that it looks okay or if I am constantly editing a photo and want a high quality true color representation then REFRESH 2 Refresh Button 3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents 4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it 5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button 6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker 7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely 8 Give me an R Give me an E Give me an F Give me an R Give me an E Give me an S Give me an H What does that spell Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to
99_122868_5,1,PDF viewer is buggier than ever,This update would be a step up if you could actually see PDF's with it
99_122869_5,2,Dropbox desktop GREAT Device App NOT,When I put things into my dropbox folder on my desktop I can find files by date modified by name etc The app has an incomprehensible and un modifyable sorting function It's almost impossible to find files within the app Once you find them on your phone I believe you can 'favorite' them But the challenge is to find them
99_122870_5,2,Sync fail,Was good until the cent updates Now my notes vanish randomly and I keep getting a sync error This app needs added features too
99_122871_5,4,Useful app some bugs,Some places that had menus on the old version are missing them on the new one Other than that the app is extremely helpful and easy to use Much improved navigation
99_122872_5,1,Not feeling the update,The new update loads slower closes out on me when i press BACK from viewing photos this update has glitches I don't like the search method and I wish you guys would make it easier to find RESORTS hotels similar to the ones you previously looked at like if I viewed a few months ago a 5 star resort with a lazy river it show me similar resorts I would like to stay at in another place state country 
99_122873_5,3,FILTERING A HOTEL SEARCHA FLAW,It is impossible to refine a hotel search for specific criteria beyond location price and quality Those are well done and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA Especially during peak seasonal flows many of us travel with pets We have a terrible time finding clean reliable hotels Most sites for pet travel are woefully inadequate How hard would it be to include this as an additional search filter That would bring in helpful reviews that would not only enhance the site experience but also improve the field
99_122874_5,3,feature request,Useful improved Happy with the progress on this app but there are many updates that seem to make no change Can't see the names of many boards there needs to be a wrapped text function on board names so long board names can be seen Indexing is very slow too many of my pins take weeks to come up in search
99_122875_5,3,feature request,Video playback sucks This is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser then to youtube Please allow for in app playback to bypass all the nonsense
99_122876_4,8,user experience,Does exactly what it says on the tin Effecient enough to check and respond to my emails
99_122877_4,8,user experience,Best of what's available I've purchased a few of these word emulator apps and Office Suite is the best It's very easy to edit with the toolbars I would give it a five but there are some word spacing issues and I've lost edits occasionally when saving to Dropbox
99_122878_4,8,user experience,Finally an Office Suite which works great I have gone through so many office suite and tried to find the suite which best support most common Microsoft Office suite applications Finally this suite fills that suite to 80 If the Font package was part of the suite then I would have given 95 and 5 star 
99_122879_4,8,user experience,Aside from the occasional glitch pretty good Awesome graphics nice sound just don't expect AC3 or 4 scale naval warfare The battles are not what I'd call real time more a cross between real and turn based Randomly sailing about is also quite pointless due to being able to fast travel almost anywhere The main missions and races are fun however as they are much less repetitive than battling There have been a few bugs but the developer seems to be squashing them quite often 
99_122880_4,8,user experience,Great app Found my Canon MX880 printer Worth the money as none of the other free applications worked to my liking 
99_122881_4,8,user experience,I like using this application for my embroidery business Enjoy using this application for my business 
99_122882_4,8,user experience,Funny Funny and exciting app You can can have new way of expressing yourself and you can make fun with others photos 
99_122883_4,10,user experience,Works I needed a app that allowed me to print to my house using my wifi This app worked perfectly and easy to setup Make sure you share your printer if using a home network and an install all the drivers for that printer If not may have issues 
99_122884_4,10,user experience,The best I really like the features especially the stickers 
99_122885_4,10,user experience,Awesome PDF performance Latest update has improved PDF viewing performance by a significant amount No more waiting for the content to appear while swiping through pages 
99_122886_4,10,user experience,Love it I really love this game game play is amazing and for this being a mobile based game the graphics are stunning 
99_122887_4,10,user experience,Beautiful Keep it up this far is the most usable app editor it makes my photos more beautiful and alive 
99_122888_4,10,user experience,Just the link needed Perfect solution for my Android Linux environment Works well with Tasker 
99_122889_4,10,user experience,Excellent From the developers of the best file manager for android Works like a charm on my S4 Droid Razr and Note II 
99_122890_4,6,Beautiful but no landscape ,Very useful But it is difficult sometimes trying to type an essay without landscape mode It is ridiculous how a word processing app doesnt let u type landscape 
99_122891_4,8,For young children,This is a short Halloween story There are several puzzles and a simple story showing Mickey who is later joined by friends My 2 1 2 year old will probably like it but the 4 year old will be bored quickly For one dollar this is ok 
99_122892_4,10, Lose It is a better ap with no fees ,I just blew 54 to sign up for three months of Weight Watchers because of this ap only to discover that this ap is not nearly as good as the free ap called Lose It When my Weight Watchers membership expires I will continue watching my food intake with Lose It Meanwhile I am monitoring my progress using both aps so the transition will be seemless So far I'm finding that Lose It is much faster and easier to use 
99_122893_4,10,Good deals,Who doesn't like a good deal every now then Usually something for everybody and easy user interface Pretty thorough app
99_122894_4,10,clean design,super convenient and nice with new alerts 
99_122895_4,6,Mr David,App works fine for basic bank accounts 
99_122896_4,10,Good time killer,Good to pass time
99_122897_4,10,Fun free game ,Harder than I thought it would be fun and neat 
99_122898_4,10,Mata,Love this app You decide how you want your collage They should add more variety of frames 
99_122899_4,10,Great app,I love having all my photos backed up automatically and not having to keep them on my phone
99_122900_4,10,Reliable Period,Have been using Google Drive for a few months paid account the desktop app was totally unreliable and failed to sync just too often So came back to Dropbox always syncing smartly and reliably A bit pricey though almost twice as expensive as competitions if you want the extra space
99_122901_4,2,recent update,I now see that you must have IO7 or better for the app I didn't wish to upgrade to IO7 on my ipad2 and can't on my orginal ipad I feel you guys tossed us out in the cold
99_122902_4,10,File sharing with ease,That moment I figured out I could transfer photos from my iPhone to laptop faster via dropbox than plugging my phone into the USB port
99_122903_4,8,Hi,I love the idea of Dropbox but my cloud does the same thing My videos take a really long time to upload I think it froze If the app didn't take up space on my iPad then I would be impressed 
99_122904_4,10,Access 247,Convenient No more lugging the laptop or losing a thumb drive My files are accessible anytime anyone from any of my devices or another's With three full time students in the house the affordable upgrade holds docs data music and more Lots of room available More convenient and more affordable than an external drive
99_122905_4,10,Good,Nice UI Keep up the good work 
99_122906_4,10,Excellent,I love the new design for iOS 7
99_122907_4,10,Looking good,New interface is great
99_122908_4,10,Great,It's a great app especially for iphone users since they can't add storage to their phones but any time u send a email to a friend inviting them to get it they give you more memory
99_122909_4,8,Good app,Works well especially for saving files for offline use
99_122910_4,8,One of the finest apps I have seen,Simple to use And the voice recognition is great 
99_122911_4,10,So good and will keep getting better,My wife and I share a 100GB account and it's amazing So many things Automatic photovideo upload iPhoto import works with the Mailbox app shared folders photo aggregation on the website and mobile the ability to store files only on the cloud saves space on my Mac from old files and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real time and accessibility of my files from anywhere I could do without it anymore Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files One suggestion if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll say for TBT don't automatically re upload it to Camera Imports It's already in Dropbox silly And yes obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload
99_122912_4,10,Must Have App ,This is a must have App as you can set it to sync all your pictures and once you take one they are saved in the cloud and also accessible by any other device you have Dropbox installed on and are signed into One amazing MUST HAVE product and App xx
99_122913_4,10,Even easier to sync stuff,I use Dropbox for everything Having this available easily on my phone made checking updates on projects from work to sharing items much easier when I'm not at a computer Also makes it easy to get photos from phone to computer since I never seem to move them Shameless plus here works great combined with Ifttt to move post record things on calendar emails contacts via spreadsheet or special folders
99_122914_4,10,Love the program,Not sure how I lived without it Best way I know to keep all my important files in one place so I can access them from anywhere on any device 
99_122915_4,10,Amazing App,Dropbox is amazing and perfect for storage and safety I love it I just wish there was an option to change the name of pictures and documents through your phone
99_122916_4,8,Very handy useful tool for syncing and sharing files,I use it to sync files between a desktop laptop iPad iPod and iPhone And for collaborating with others by using shared files and folders I once had a problem on my iPad with an endless loop asking me to connect to iTunes But that turned out to be an Apple problem which for me could only be solved by a complete erase and restore Since the problem only occurred in DropBox I initially assumed it was their problem It was not
99_122917_4,10,The only cloud app that works,I've tried Google Drive Box Skydrive but none of them could upload a 20 minute video I took Dropbox was the only one that accepted my file
99_122918_4,10,54gb of memory,I can pretty much have access to all my photos and videos on the go without it taking space on my phone Love ittt 3
99_122919_4,10,Awesome,Dropbox works great I can access files anywhere Highly recommend
99_122920_4,10,Easy to use,Simple just what I needed to make transferring certain photos from phone to computer and vice versa simple Thanks 
99_122921_4,8,Great app missing one really important function,This app is really useful for having access to documents while I'm out The one big thing I think it lacks is a way to share folders while you're using the app I'd love to be able to share a folder via the app and I've needed to so this before while I was out but unfortunately this app as of 3113 doesn't have that feature It would be really useful to have 
99_122922_4,10,Good,Very convenient for moving files without connecting to a computer 
99_122923_4,2,Failing after today's update,I rely on Dropbox for syncing daily annotated PDFs from my iPad to my home computer After today's update sync stopped working
99_122924_4,10,Excellent,It's a really good cloud app but what makes it stand out is the new pdf viewer Now I can read huge files on the iPad You can't do that on Google Drive's app
99_122925_4,10,Yay sort by date ,This was a long wait very glad to have this feature 
99_122926_4,8,PDF viewer is a game changeralmost,I use several apps for PDF viewing and one feature that keeps me on the prowl for the holy grail of PDF viewers is an app that supports PDF markup Being a musician and heavy e reader I rely heavily on PDF markup Dropbox give us some simple PDF markup abilities eg highlight pen erase opacity and you will put several PDF viewer apps to bed Couple these features with the ability to share a folder of PDFs with other Dropbox users and you've converted me and countless others to PDF viewing through Dropbox
99_122927_4,10,Wow,The new PDF reader is AWESOME 
99_122928_4,6,Great app but,It takes forever to upload photos 2 3 weeks after I started the photos finally became viewable I had no problems installing the last update I love the recent upgrades Syncs perfectly Sharing is easy Overall a great app but needs a few tweaks
99_122929_4,10,Very productive ap ,This works wonderful on my iPhone 4S I have many things on my PC and it automatically syncs to my iPhone I am never without important documents that I need to review or look up that are password encoded Super easy and a huge time saver Love it 
99_122930_4,6,15 min streaming limit,I gotta say overall I like this app although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth The reason is because I start downloading the whole file then start streaming it Once the 15 min is up I then switch to the downloaded file To me this uses more data Why can't I just stream the whole thing Overall though I like everything else about this app
99_122931_4,10,Good app,Nice and smooth photo streaming from device to device
99_122932_4,10,SIX stars,Honestly it took me some time to get used to using this application web clipping photo notes sharing etc but now I find this app to be the 'deal killer' the one thing that MUST be on every device The note scanning is so powerful it can read my scribbles take notes in a meeting take pics in evernote throw them out We are now exploring the business application sky's the limit
99_122933_4,10,Use it for everything,It's wonerful I keep recipes receipts knitting patterns copies of postcards and greeting cards from friends car maintenance records appliance manuals parts numbers for appliance parts and many other things I keep schedules for my favorite sports teams information about attractions I would like to visit the next time I travel to various cities I keep business cards and journal articles that I use at work Easy to search for information when I need it
99_122934_4,10,Why not be more generous ,Good app for noting but too expensive to use it for poor students 60mb is not enoughcould you make it more plz 
99_122935_4,4,Would benefit trying again,Green interface doesn't look or feel good Nor is it more useful Maximizing space to type in should be the goal however it doesn't feel like it The app still works It's clunky and advertising too much It probably isn't even an issue they may have rolled out the advertisements at the wrong time
99_122936_4,10,Enjoyed it,I started to use evernote since high school but didn't feel that useful Now i am a college student I use evernote in every life I love the highlight section but wish there is more color than yellow Moreover I enjoy the website version as well It is organized and sophistic Thank you for providing this application It is so convenience
99_122937_4,10,Evernote is the best for productivity,Once I learned to use the notebookmultiple tag search I was very pleased with the new update I use Evernote for my GTD system and primarily work on iPad The new graphics are great Thanks for my most used app
99_122938_4,8,Amazing app however,The most amazing app for sure the most used on my iPad however I liked some features of the older version please bring back the option to make Paragraph headers and subsections The typing could be faster but Still great app
99_122939_4,4,Fix the camera album bug ,I like the UI improvements with the new version The old UI was hideous and I usually used En via another app like drafts or IFTTT But the fact that I cannot add recent photos from my album This is the main function for me of Evernote This must be fixed 
99_122940_4,10,Good for Me,I like the concept and automation using the subject line
99_122941_4,10,Indespensible,I use EN constantly through the day for various productivity tasks It performs well and all my devices are always in sync so my files and notes are always handy No crashes or complaints with the new design It just works and I love it
99_122942_4,4,Brilliant Service Awful design,I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college It's a wonderful service and up until the iOS7 redesign the apps have always worked great But the design of this app is terrible It's jumbled confusing and lots of advertising for their service add ons and 'news' get in the way of core functionality Please redesign the app Again
99_122943_4,2,Sales pitches for premium users and broken features,This version still has a marketplace full of ads I can't hide and the image attachment only shows me pics from September and earlier So it's pretty useless Quit trying to sell me stuff and fix your bugs 
99_122944_4,10,Pure Awesome,The only reason I moved to iOS7 was to get the newest version of Evernote Let me say I have no idea what everyone is complaining about Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Handy announcements from Evernote The card view is still there you just have to gasp look for a sec If you are having issues contact support before blasting the app And take a deep breath folks Life isn't that bad
99_122945_4,8,Evernote App,The app is missing a few things compared to the computer based version but overall functionality is pretty good The only reason I don't give the app 5 stars is because the new interface is absolutely ugly Although this is just a personal opinion I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing If this changes I will give it 5 stars
99_122946_4,4,Not thrilled with iOS 7 version,I love love love Evernote It is the only way I remember anything Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible The new interface seems to have buried things I want most Such as Sync Now and Search Sync seems to be broken regardless I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does using my first sentence Another new annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again working like the desktop version would be better here Finally it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault It is
99_122947_4,2,v7 does not sync,My Mac OS X version is working fine but the app does not upload my data until I soft reset the phone Useless iOS 7 iPhone 5
99_122948_4,8,Great App ,I've used other note taking apps before but this is my favorite I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of all its capabilities but I love the fact that it will sync across all my devices My notes are easy to find It would've great if there was a way to hide some of my notebooks with a password for secure data That's the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five
99_122949_4,6,Needs some tweaking,Great app that I have used regularly but seems a bit jerky since the iOS 7 update and update of app itself A bit off putting when trying to type 
99_122950_4,4,Note size limit ,I use evernote for most of my note taking but now I have to pay 5 dollars a month just for a slightly longer note Ridiculous 
99_122951_4,8,Great for paper clutter,I am using this to reduce paper clutter in my house So far so good Notes from the kids' school and organizations get photographed and organized in one notebook Notes for parties in another Ideas for the house are organized too including pictures from home and garden magazines Love it so far I am a little worried however that I need access to the Internet for it Not sure if this will work then
99_122952_4,2,Lost Everything ,I loved Evernotesthat is Until I download iOS7 With their new and improved look they also did away with everything you ever had saved They did however manage to maintain the notebook namesunfortunately all of the notes within those notebooks were erased I used this app for work and personal businessall files gone Be sure to only use this app for unimportant notes Very disappointed 
99_122953_4,8,Had to delete and reinstall to fix missing data,I have over 200 notes in Evernote verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted and reinstalled it Logging out and logging back in didn't work The new UI will take some getting used to but feels cleaner and faster than before
99_122954_4,10,A must have app,I have to say that Evernote is in the top 3 ranking of my productivity apps if not number 1 So simple to use I use it to store all sorts of data that I need to be able to recall quickly Great for note taking recipes software keys wifi settings Endless uses
99_122955_4,10,great app for projects recipes,Easy camera function allows for adding recipes right to notebook Separate notebooks make keeping all pieces of a project together regardless of media Used it for remodeling projects and it's where I keep my collection of recipes regardless of initial source Have used it for about a year and unlike other apps I'm still using it
99_122956_4,10,Fabulous ,Absolutely love this app Found out about it from a fellow Southwestair flyer Use it all the time for 'must saves' from twitter the internet Easy to use with folders tags Can keep all of my daily notes thoughts close at hand
99_122957_4,10,Just gets better with use,The more I use Evernote the more ways I find to use it Love the excellent and consistent multi platform experience and sync
99_122958_4,10,Great,Syncs great with desktop Allowing me to keep my thoughts organized and accessible
99_122959_4,10,Vital in digital age,Keeps track of any and everything and just keeps getting better Whether it is a document or a picture it can be captured ether by email or snapping a photo and you then have it forever Retrieving it is simple by tags or searching It just makes life simpler
99_122960_4,10,Surprised to be using it so much,After I downloaded this it just sat on my desktop for a million years Then I got the bright idea of taking a screen snapshot of an Expedia itinerary Wow Suddenly I am off and running saving and accessing info on everything from learning disabilities to salad dressings I would like it better if there were multi layer nesting available for the notebooks but it is pretty cool Btw I use the skitch add on for editing reformatting bold print etc It's great
99_122961_4,2,I loved Evernote until today,Evernote is now virtually unusable I was simply trying to toggle check marks in my grocery list yesterday and it would take three or more attempts to acknowledge me and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up without any reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list When the program did finally acknowledge me the check marks would be delayed by about 2 seconds each as if it had to stop and sync between every gesture Do people even test apps before release any more Who thought 'Oh yeah this looks perfect ' should be fired
99_122962_4,10,good for what I need,Probably the beat all around note taking app good for pretty much everything
99_122963_4,10,It just works Great,A wonderful substitute for loss of brain function in middle age It remembers everything for me across platforms 
99_122964_4,2,This app is a complete waste,Not worth your time unless you like to be disappointed
99_122965_4,10,Evernote saves marriages,From baby feeding and diaper changes to shopping lists and research papers our family shares everything Thanks Evernote 
99_122966_4,8,New User Loves It So Far,As stated in the title I am a new user Even though I've only been using Evernote for about two months I have come to greatly depend on it It is fabulous to be able to record a meeting and take notes at the same time I can't imagine anything better I hope to find out all the other ways I can use it

99_122971_4,10,Great organizing tool,I use it to keep track of recipes make notes on hobbies keep up with maintenance tasks
99_122972_4,10,Useful above all,This is a wonderful app that enables users to write about whatever they need in a variety of ways on a variety of devices
99_122973_4,6, 450 is too much,It's a lot of money for what a mounts to a great sorting system for notes if you're a flake like me Looking back I should just have kept those little slips of paper in my pocket
99_122974_4,10,The best,Afterr trying many organizers over the last year I am settling on Evernote Is easiest and most intuitive to use syncs so easily to laptop
99_122975_4,8,Love,Golly this app makes my memory obsolete I never have to recall anything again it's here it's on my computer it's on the interwebs Weee 
99_122976_4,10,Essential Tool,I use Evernote for work and personal use I was an early adopter and have found it to be an incredibly useful tool for productivity personal reference and as an idea base It is extremely reliable intuitive and something I use many times a day I love it and highly recommend it to others
99_122977_4,8,Quite good,Impressed by its versatility in terms of the type of note one can take It's great to have the ability to input URL photos audio and text And great that it has desktop integration for a computer The drawback that I've encountered is though it offers labels it doesn't offer folders Editing and the dashboard in the app could use an easier interface Still good app though
99_122978_4,8,Daily go to,Evernote is my daily Goto app for all of my actions and to dos The file folder UI can be clunky but under the covers this app delivers
99_122979_4,8,Replaces a dozen three ring binders,I've been using this for just over 6 weeks and have eliminated all paper notes Even when I find myself at a meeting without a laptop or iPad my paper notes easily get loaded in simply by snapping a photo Additionally classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to organize among a couple different dimensions for easy retrieval at a later date
99_122980_4,10,Love it ,I'm loving the organization and ease Evernote brings to my life It's new reminders feature has been amazing 
99_122981_4,10,Great tool ,Have been using Evernote forfiver a year now very easy to use program love the syncing with my desktop phone iPad etc

99_122983_4,8,Good stuff,Simple easy to use note taking app Sometimes not all notes are available when not on wireless network
99_122984_4,10,Must have for a writer ,As a writerdaydreamer I'm constantly in my head thinking up new ideas and having a tool that allows me to access my material pretty much anywhere is fantastic Instead of just jotting down a note which I can't always do and referring to it later on once I've gotten home logged onto a computer opened up a Word document it's so much easier and convenient to do it on this app I've even used Evernote for school stuff essays mostly so there's no need for emailing documents to myself There are only a few errorsglitches that I've encountered but nothing that makes me want to stop using this app I love it too much 
99_122985_4,10,Great app ,Syncs well and wonderful for projects at work and home
99_122986_4,8,Great tool for my notes,I love the fact that Evernote allows me to sync my notes between each of my devices and computers I use it everyday to keep everything right in front of me I wish the interface a bit different Maybe the option of colored notes 
99_122987_4,10,Great super versatile notes app,Editing ability and consistency on iPhone has improved with recent updates Still some work to do to allow additional font sizes and such for items created on iPhone Should get a 45 for that reason but it would be unfair to rate this a 4 bc of those minor limitations Robust editing on Mac online allow workarounds
99_122988_4,10,Must Have Stores Everything,Ok what don't I use Evernote for Nothing I use for everything Storing contacts business cards my son's artwork recipes food journals workout logs useful documents receipts magazine clippings In this new version I can finally edit notebooks on my phone I'm 99 mobile I love that you can access your notes from anywhere My husband has the Evernote pen an takes notes during his meetings He looses his notebooks but the pen syncs with Evernote and all his handwritten notes are there Super cool I also use Evernote Food App which syncs with Evernote Awesome

99_122990_4,10,Time saver ,This app has made my job and life so much easier It is available on all platforms and syncs automatically There are updates all of the time I have been using this for about a year now and I have never had an issue with losing notes I use this to write my notes for billing so that part is crucial Thanks for making my life easier 
99_122991_4,10,Terrific resource ,I love Evernote The convenience of saving web info documents from airline itineraries to e tickets to office documents to photos etc on my IPad or my computer is wonderful The fact it works on pc platforms is a real bonus Put the info on one device and you have it on all your devices Thank you developers

99_122994_4,8,Blissful,This app is in a word blissful Seriously everything I want and need to do and all the ways I want to take notes annotated and tagged images clippings articles news reports etc offered in a nicely bound package that helps keep organized Its like sticky notes moleskins pages zotero and Instagram all in one
99_122995_4,10,Fantastic ,I'm a writer and so I was always constantly using the original notes app that comes with apple products But it strangely deleted all my notes twice So I decided I needed something better I went through many different note taking apps but none sufficed Then I found Evernote and was so pleased Thank you guys so much You make note taking fun and easy

99_122999_4,10,It's my memory bank ,No more magazine clippings One place for to do lists Would love to see the ability to set alarms and send reminders One of my favorite and most versatile apps
99_123000_4,2,Complain,I would like to say that I do not like the fact that the password has to be reset
99_123001_4,8,Good But Wireless Integration,Easy to use for quick concise note taking Would be fantastic if you could freehand and if the compatibility with wireless keyboards was more efficient Example Apple 'Command' key cannot control boldunderliningitalics functions You still have to use screen
99_123002_4,10,Web clipping,I use it all the time I especially like the web clipper and then emailing right from Evernote
99_123003_4,8,Great app for students,Great for slow note takers I use it for all my classes wish there was a bullet option

99_123008_4,10,My favorite organization tool ,I absolutely love being able to save notes and organize them in notebooks I use this app daily Two of my most useful notebooks are 1 Storing recipes 2 Medical info such as current meds I also love that I can view it all on various devices I do wish that when sharing the notes they didn't look like garble when I use colors and formatting Also I haven't found an undo option on the app version so when I accidentally delete content I have to do it over The app still deserves 5 stars hands down though 
99_123009_4,10,Remarkable,I have had this program for over a year now I use it for all my note taking No more pads Easy to share information with staff with a few key strokes A great app
99_123010_4,8,Awesome App,Evernote is my go to for everything whether lists meeting notes just things to remember etc The only thing that I wish it had is a date driven 'to do' or reminder Then it would be the only app I would ever use for all things productivity

99_123013_4,10,Productive and amazing,This app is a must have for those in the professional world It is a great way to stay 'green' by storing documents rather than printing hard copies The ability to search notes and PDFs makes old fashioned pen and paper obsolete The integration with Penultimate is pleasing for those who still wish to 'write' rather than type

99_123017_4,8,Very user friendly,Very easy to use on any device or OS
99_123018_4,10,It is what it is,It is what it says it is which is refreshing A place to collect all the pieces of information that can clutter your life Sure it takes some work on your part to sort it all out but you have to get it in one place first That is what Evernote does best It's on my iPhone iPad and MacBook I use it everyday
99_123019_4,8,Good app,Had a lot of trouble at first with phone shutting down app for no reason but not as of late Great app for keeping me organized I use for keeping records on equipment

99_123024_4,8,My Auxiliary Brain ,Love it Haven't gotten too much in place yet but already I've come to depend on this Few things to make it 'The One' for my organizing heart in the most drool inducing order 1 Ability to swipe through notes like flipping pages in a books 2 Sub foldersnotebook 3 Ability to highlight re positionable sticky notes are a dream 4 Colors I get cross eyed hunting through a long list of same colored notebooks The ability to sort and organize by color would be wonderful I'd know exactly what section to go to rather quickly This has let me collect my notes from my Palm Blackberry iPhone PCwherever and put them in one place I feel so un scattered Amazing how much information we and Evernote can hold
99_123025_4,8,It's not one note but it will do for Mac users,I wish ms would release one note on apple though
99_123026_4,10,Productivity Increase,Great tool to consolidate your notes
99_123027_4,10,Awesome app,Awesome app allows you to easily create and share notes pictures diagrams and ideas between devices in a highly organized fashion This is good if you're a scatter brain like me and never know when inspiration will strike but would lose it if if wasn't easy to categorize ie traditional postit note model where they don't end up helping because they're everywhere 
99_123028_4,10,Most versatile app I have acquired ,I love the do anything note capabilities text inline photos audio files web clips which I have yet to become proficient with but will The cross platform access to your notes on the cloud is brilliant and a HUGE time saver This app combined with the inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that I bought recently have given me a power mobile information gathering and organizing capability
99_123029_4,10,greatest organization tool ,even with the latest glitches evernote is still one of the only apps on my phone i use daily best program to keep up with my life super glad it is on the iphone 
99_123030_4,2,I quit,Waited for this update then we get this EverNote is no longer for taking text notes It is now obvious to me and I have been in denial for over a year There is no font control editing is random and buggy slow as molasses and unreliable when you take time to write a paragraph you want 100 confidence EverNote will not crash midway or you get Synchronization Fail and thus lose your work Note sorting and text friendly organization ie lists have been thrown out the window for a shiny interface and lots of icons and flashy graphics I can't write with the confidence that EverNote will not crash but HEY I can take a picture of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey EverFail I quit I am canceling my membership today When you get serious about EverNote as a tool for work send me an email Actually don't bother
99_123031_4,10,Awesome tool ,I love love this app Evernote is so easy to use and very functional when surfing the web It's like having a mini assistant helping take notes 
99_123032_4,2,It's Crazy to use this, 50 bucks a year to use this iCloud is FREE Why do we have to pay so much money to get access Is there a rule in our iTunes account that we have to like whatever junk they tell us to like 
99_123033_4,10,Evernote and GTD have changed everything ,I get things done I'm organized I don't waste time at work it's changed my game plan Still learning all the aspects of Evernote it's just opened up a place where I love to work again because I accomplish so much more in less time 5 star review is well deserved 
99_123034_4,10,The only notes app worth using,This new layout is awesome Use this app daily and love it
99_123035_4,8,Lexus Sales Consultant,I am extremely excited about the possibilities for tracking my prospects and clients in a user friendly manner with evernotes The Tag and Search functions make it easy to recall prospects who are interested in specific models new and used I can order the searches to look at latest entries first which is very important in my business Many other applications work well but I do have one observation that you should be aware of There seems to be a bug in the search function for notebooks when you do a search in a specific notebook The all notebooks search works fine as does the tag search breakdown All in all this is a great program
99_123036_4,2,Holiday travel nightmare at dollar,We arrived at dollar with a 2 pm reservation plus the rapid service I signed up for last week It's now been over an hour in line The placed is mobed with hundreds of customers in line yet very very few counters open It's about 40 running There is no where to sit and crying babies and disappointed families in every corner Food is on the floor and the place is complete disarray I will never rent of the dump again I would rather walk Actually if I had walked to Pasadena I would be almost there Plus the staff are rude and ignorant No compassion for the customers standing in this never ending line rather than be with their families for Xmas My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mom She has a whole dinner planned tonight Unfortunately we will be here at dollar waiting for our pre reserved rental car Rush hour starts in 30 minutes that will end any chance of seeing my family tonight Shame on dollar for not properly staffing their rental car center during the important holida

99_123045_4,10,TripAdvisor is the BEST Travel App ,TripAdvisor is as much a part of my travel plans as my suitcase and change of clothes I love the ability to search for bargains in travel and lodging and get the inside baseball on what I can expect from local hotels and restaurants The iPhone app works flawlessly on my 4S and it is very helpful to have by my side TripAdvisor Five Stars 
99_123046_4,10,Honest Advice,Consensus averages gives good sense of what to expect Reviewers are generally truthful and steer you straight
99_123047_4,10,Great Informatipn,Tripadvisor is a great appwebsite that provides excellent common sense critical information for the traveller no matter where you go Conditions of the facilityrestaurant cost service provided by the staff and more are at your fingertips Feedback is provided by actual travelers so you are provided with honest results A definite place to check when you aren't sure 
99_123048_4,10,Best all 'round travel review app,I've been using advisor for years and apparently I just now getting around to giving it a review Such a huge diversity of focus areas like restaurants hotels and attractions along with a huge user base which increases the value of the app exponentially
99_123049_4,10,Great,Very helpful for me Love the reviews for helping me find places when I don't have a guide book with me
99_123050_4,10,Enzozozozo101,This is an overall great update and had made more quickness and also just a smoother running app tripadvisor itself is the best app to find a restaurant or hotel that suits your needs love the consistent users and current up to date reviews only draw is the distance filter is no longer there so it sets 50 mi radius bit far when u want to go 20 or less but besides that amazing 
99_123051_4,10,Love it ,What a great app Easy to use info is accurate and everything you need to know as a traveler or tourist 
99_123052_4,8,Solid reliable,No issues on the performance side with this app Like the UI and find it overall easy to navigate and handle
99_123053_4,10,Great for the frequent traveler,I started using trip advisor when my husband got a traveling job and I occasionally would go with him Since then we have been addicted and I've hooked my parents on it too Great for finding local gems in restaurants and decent hotels I love seeing the trip advisor signs when I go into restaurants now Everyone can be a critic
99_123054_4,10,Trip Advisor review,Best info on hotels hands down 
99_123055_4,10,Love Tripadvisor,I user this site for all my travel needs Check out the forums to interact with others making your same trip 
99_123056_4,10,Love it,Love this app Have it on my iPhone iPad and computer They all sync Nice Use it on the go to look up restaurants and use it to research all our trips The reviews and forums are great trip tools
99_123057_4,8,Paris trip,Extremely helpful in France We only went to restaurants rated by TA
99_123058_4,4,Use with caution ,Reviews are great but Tilripadvisor reads them first They review photos too I have a negative review and they wouldn't post the photos Something about the photos not being clear Bullsh t They were mint and I even had my BF take photos and give them to me Ridiculous Speaking the truth is a problem for them I had undercooked chicken and they didn't want to post that I could've been sick If they prefer to alter reviews then why bother 
99_123059_4,10,Love love love,My family travels ALL the time and this app has been a life saver numerous times I use it for everything now Highly recommend 
99_123060_4,10,Great site app,My husband and I always use trip advisor before vacations So much useful information
99_123061_4,10,Awesome app ,Great app to write my reviews on Very user friendly and easy to navigate
99_123062_4,10,Trip Advisor always my first stop,I always read all the reviews while we are traveling on the road My husband and I crisscross the country every summer and I am the navigator I find most reviewers to be honest if you read all of them or at least half you can get a pretty good opinion Many times I didn't pay attention to a negative review because I thought they had some sort of personal problem and was sorry afterwards Trip advisor is a good opinion to take into account when you are traveling in a new place and have no idea where to go
99_123063_4,4,A few bugs in the new version,The new complete rewrite version is a disappointment Very slow to no response to photo paging requests lack of hotel search facility for a given city and incomplete searches for hotels These are just a few problems I noted on first use of rewritten app Needs some work Hopefully there will be an update released soon This used to be a great app
99_123064_4,8,Good Encyclopedia,I find it an useful tool It is helpful to read multiple opinions one can generally wade through the static and determine what fits It has a vast amount of data but be careful and glean from other sources to get information Remember it is a tool to help plan and execute your own trip use many data points and don't look for perfect wisdom Some people's jewels are NOT others treasures Of I had to put a value I would say about 70 accurate including my own ratings I am very picky some people just want to be out of the rain
99_123065_4,10,Love to travel,Love trip advisor I use it every time I'm out of time for restaurants and have never gone wrong I have tried other food apps and they are not even close to being as accurate A plus is the fact they don't mess with rating fast food restaurants Who needs a star rating for a McDonalds Burger King etc Also very good for finding a good hotel
99_123066_4,10,Great for exploring,Us this in every city for finding new resturants Most picks are great Locally run and owned A must app for foodies 
99_123067_4,10,Great app,I have used this for vacations to Paris Miami and Cape Cod Always find fun things to do and good food
99_123068_4,10,Super util,Excelente informacion me encantan las fotos de los turistas
99_123069_4,10,Awesome,I never book a room without checking the reviews on this site first I love how I can read reviews from 'real' people and not what someone in marketing came up with to entice me into staying I recommend this to everyone 
99_123070_4,10,Wonderful App,The TripAdvisor App is a shorter and better way to look up something instead of going onto their website and wasting more time Sometimes you can't always find what you are looking for so you have to go on the website but it's the majority I do all of my bookings with TripAdvisor through the app or through the Internet and it still works very well Great job 
99_123071_4,10,Love the trip ,Trip advisor is an awesome tool to share with others experiences that you've had to allow others to see how a hotel attraction etcis before they make their choice So thank you for having this app 
99_123072_4,10,What a tremendous resource ,I'm planning a trip to Italy for myself and several friends and the information and reviews on trip advisor have been invaluable How else would I know about cooking classes in Cortona Or about which tours in Rome Florence and Venice are the best value 
99_123073_4,10,Review,Very helpful and informative for both stateside and overseas
99_123074_4,10,Great app ,Has been helpful in locating great places to stay and eat from south Alabama to Arkansas to Texas

99_123079_4,10,Best App if you live on the road ,I am on the road 5 days out of the week and I needed a dependable application for locating hotels restaurants Starbucks etc Trip Advisor filled the bill 100 Trip Advisor is the bible for the business person who lives on the road
99_123080_4,10,Saved trips,Love that you can save your stops on a trip for easy reference We've really benefitted from using Trip Advisor and loce the ease of access that comes with the app
99_123081_4,10,Nice for Advice ,Love being able to look up the specific areas I'm visiting and have LOCALS chiming in too 
99_123082_4,2,Not good app doesn't do the website justice,When you search for something and they don't have it in their database the only option you have is to add the place or completely close out and get back in it to go back to the search bar
99_123083_4,10,Bravo,Great app Very trustworthy and reliable Always works as promised and delivers useful info and travel tips 
99_123084_4,8,Love it,I like that it gives you more info about the area Like that I get more feedback how is everyone experience And it give more knowledge where and what to do

99_123097_4,10,Very Useful App,Used to find lodge in Amazonia judge restaurant options in London
99_123098_4,10,A Great Way to find hotels and restaurants ,I use this app quite a bit to find restaurants and hotels both near and far And I contribute quite a bit Definitely worth using 
99_123099_4,8,Pretty good,It's a good version of the website It's not great for stuff in the US but it's great for international advice and it's an easier platform to post reviews than yelp
99_123100_4,10,A perfect traveling companion ,We use the recommendations regularly to find restaurants during our travels We are rarely disappointed Need I say more 
99_123101_4,8,Good app but watch for battery drain,I've been using this app to plan and manage an overseas trip It has Ben great so far withstand couple of minor issues When left running in the background on some modes I think it keeps location services on which seems to be draining my battery faster than usual I'm not sure if it is that or in just using it more than normal It'd be great if there was a way to see my 'saves' sorted by distance as well as a way to mark them as seen Finally when I'm using this while traveling I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review but remind me later waits about 5 minutes and them pesters me again so a star off for that
99_123102_4,10,First Place to Check,I've been contributing to TripAdvisor for many years now It is the first place I check when heading to a new area for information on hotels restaurants and activities The app on my iPad makes it easy for on the go reviews It is easy to use and quite intuitive in how it works No complaints
99_123103_4,10,Great app for traveling,Get the app whether before you go or once you arrive You'll have great information on food reviews to leverage for your stay Use them to enjoy the experience of your vacation
99_123104_4,10,Great app,Very convenient useful info and easy to use
99_123105_4,10,Great App,I am really using this Tripadvisor to receive information about hotels restaurants etc The reviews by others seem to be in line with my experiences at the places reviewed
99_123106_4,10,Such an invaluable resource while travelling,I downloaded the city app while I was travelling and was very happy to find that the maps worked even without using data
99_123107_4,10,Real people real reviews,I like the candor reflected in the reviews Some people like what I like and some propel do not It is usually easy to fit the review to the reviewer and get a good picture of whether the place and the person might like or not care for the same things as I A good source of information for all 'trips'
99_123108_4,8,Wonderful and easy to use,I prefer it to Kayak and Travelocity
99_123109_4,10,Very pleased,Love trip advisor on the big screen This app brings the usefulness of the iPhone program to the iPad Thanks for a good program Very useful when on the road to find the best places Thanks to all who take the time to provide reviews I have offered reviews for years and glad others do as well
99_123110_4,10,Great Travel App,Have used in US Ireland and Continental Europe easy to use good information including location numbers and web site Reviews are personal preference but knowing a majority opinion makes selecting places and events easy
99_123111_4,10,Ubiquitous,I love that tripadvisor can guide you no matter where you are We had about an hour to kill for lunch in Fresno CA before a return flight home to Texas We found the best Mediterranean restaurant through tripadvisor Thank you Trip Advisor 
99_123112_4,10,AgreedTrip Advisor Yelp,While visiting in Philippines discovered TA while evaluating lodging choices Then discovered all the related features which included rich info on local eateries and things to see and do Yelp included nothing in the Philippines It's the strong international contribution by the users like me that make this App really good It won a place on my home page
99_123113_4,10,Excellent resource,Great app website Extremely useful Real life reviews are always better than sales pitch brochures and recommendations I use this a lot even if I'm not traveling The fun of exploring thru this app creates travel dreams and a great education
99_123114_4,10,Great Site APP,Love the search engine and the reviews though I should read them before I go out more often I like submitting my honest reviews as I see them and am glad people can take what I have to say and make their own opinion I use the site a lot when traveling to search out places to eat and stay and some are spot on and some not That is why you have to make a personal decision on things
99_123115_4,8,Useful app search features could be more extensive,I found this app pretty helpful overall for finding hotels and reading reviews however the search feature was a bit limited and didn't allow me to filter by brand name easily This would be a nice feature to add
99_123116_4,8,So far although not very far so good,it's been very helpful with booking a room dining etc the few times I've used it
99_123117_4,10,Awesomeness ,So easy to use 
99_123118_4,10,I use it Shop Go and Rate,I use it whenever we travel I'd rather find places and read reviews that others have posted I go and then post my thoughts So far those who use and rate places are very fair and honest What else are you looking for 
99_123119_4,10,Very VERY Helpful,I work a hotel myself always recommend that our guests post on trip advisor I was browsing looking at our ratings when I found myself browsing other hotels around the country now I want to travel more just to go to the hotels in my saved list Very helpful in reviews I find it better than Yelp Or any other review website
99_123120_4,10,Best travel app out there,Using it to read up on the places we will be going both before we booked for the reviews and after booking for tips and tricks Mobile access to the forums is also great
