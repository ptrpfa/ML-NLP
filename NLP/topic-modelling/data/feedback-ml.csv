99_3266_2,problem discovery,Sometime I can t click to go to websites but overall good app 
99_3267_5,feature request,I still feel all these larger companies should have the email synch up with my app so when I get an alert and click on the email it should go to my app not the web page 
99_3268_4,information giving,Now however I just like it they decided to change the entire way you pin the look of everything and made all the type small and not as colorful and pleading to the eye 
99_3269_4,information giving,I would never be able to see so many of the wonderful things the world has to offer if not for Pinterest 
99_3270_4,information giving,Love using Pinterest to research all kinds of things and usually find info more appropriate for what I want to know then on other search engines

99_3281_4,information giving,That s a minor issue though 
99_3282_4,information giving,I love Pinterest the apps are more user friendly than the website BUT there needs to be a way to mark where you stopped browsing on your home feed

99_3284_4,information giving,It s helping me to plan a bunch of different things I want to accomplish in the future and I am so excited for that 
99_3285_4,information giving,There are quite a few pins that you click on and it will only pull up a picture or take you to a completely different page but other than that when you find those pages that take you right where you need to be there s a world of wonders out there 
99_3286_4,information giving,Like any other App it might have its moments but all in all it s fantastic

99_3348_4,information giving,I do wish with all the new updates they made a slide show option because sometimes I just want to flip through my pins instead of having to click on each one one at a time

99_3446_2,problem discovery,If I had to say there was a problem it would be that this app is too addicting 
99_3447_2,problem discovery,This needs to be fixed 
99_3448_4,information giving,The addition of secret boards was a great idea 
99_3449_5,feature request,If only every pin had a direct link to how to buy it or the items inside

99_3710_5,feature request,This app needs to support older OS versions 
99_3711_4,information giving,Instead of having multiple paper notebooks or little notes everywhere everything I need to remember or reference goes into Evernote 
99_3712_4,information giving,Our minds need Evernote to actually function today as the creative thinking creatures we are and unburden us from the voluminous mundane which informs our thinking 
99_3713_4,information giving,While there are still functions which are not yet available on all mobile platforms these do not detract from the unequivocal 5 rating

99_3720_4,information giving,Please stop all the enhancements

99_3731_2,problem discovery,Reason for only 4 stars is because some features are not available across all platforms 
99_3732_2,problem discovery,The app seemingly does not support cut and paste after IOS7 upgrade 
99_3733_5,feature request, n nI d give 5 stars but Evernote really need to give feature parity with their desktop version 
99_3734_4,information giving,It used to allow adding multiple tags at once 
99_3735_4,information giving,Just clip all thoughts you have from any medium to the software and it is recall able 
99_3736_4,information giving,Well worth the download and will purchase the subscription once I learn more on how to maximize it 
99_3737_2,problem discovery,Ever since EverNote 'upgraded' to iOS7 style it has been a poorly designed bloated app that constantly crashes

99_3755_5,feature request,Also wish there was a way to view all notes in Flipboard and to display alerts for random notes 
99_3756_4,information giving,I don t need any other note taking apps to store my notes 
99_3757_4,information giving,Every time I have something come up with in my mind I just simply take a draft in Evernote and tag it as idea 
99_3758_2,problem discovery,It crashes constantly 
99_3759_2,problem discovery,When I update a note on my PC it takes forever to show up after I sync on phone sometimes I even have to log out and back for it to show up 
99_3760_4,information giving,So because of this program I updated my iOS and it changed its look completely and its stability 
99_3761_2,problem discovery,It crashes every time within 2 minutes of using it

99_3945_4,information giving,Don t listen to anybody who gave them one star they are just mad because they didn t get any followers 
99_3946_5,feature request,The way I think is to categorize first and then comment but once you select a category you ve pinned it and then you must do the several step process of editing

99_3987_4,information giving,Decks for the backyard was really fun when we were planning our backyard update 
99_3988_5,feature request,The only thing I would love added to Pinterest overall is keywords because a lot of times the captions for the pin do not contain any information about what the pin is about and then there is no way to search for it

99_4518_2,Bummed cant share folders,It allows me to share individual photos but not entire folders What good is that I can easily text someone a single photo WTH I want to be able to send a link to people of an entire folder with many pics in it from my mobile Seems useless now On the other hand I do like that I can view and share excel documents That's pretty cool Although it does take quite a while to load it seems
99_4519_2,Hard to navigate,You can't scroll very well when your trying to find a hotel there's no search function that would find the hotel I was staying at and the attractions around and close by When scrolling the hotels you would get to the bottom but it would let go on the the next 20 until you tap on a hotel then you could scroll down to the next 20 It has some good photos of every thing when you find it it doesn't perform well on my iPad it's slow and it hard find what information your looking for if I was to use to book a hotel it might be worth it
99_4520_2,No more options for styling as paragraph or section ,I can't believe you guys removed one of the most useful features of Evernote which was the ability to style lines as either a section subsection paragraph or blockquote That was the only way we could give some hierarchy to our notes Now all my notes are one dimensional and its impossible to organize my thoughts How could the Evernote team consider that this feature was unnecessary Do you guys not use your own app How am I supposed to outline my notes This is really a big let down to an otherwise great update But it's too big an omission for me too be happy about anything else That's why I give it 2 stars
99_4521_2,Really Bad Transfer,I just tested this app out so that I could view Horrible Bosses as an UltraViolet Digital Copy and I noticed that the movie was hard to see in some places because of what looked like really bad blurry areas right after the logos This happened throughout the movie This never happened to me with the regular digital copies that were compatible with iTunes I could see everything clearly when I was using the regular digital copies I think that if I have to buy these combo packs with UltraViolet Digital Copy I will never use this app again I'll stick to the UltraViolet Flixster cloud because there it wasn't blurry at all On top of this since the update ALL the UltraViolet movies are buffering and skipping This never happened with my last update Please fix 
99_4522_2,Keeps freezing,The app used to work great but now it keeps freezing and I can't get into my notes It is very frustrating I have to delete the app and download it again What a pain 
99_4523_2,Great app when it works,Freezing on start up all the time Becomes useless Considering other apps
99_4524_2,Way too many hang ups ,Hangs up multiple points in interface Way too buggy to be useable 
99_4525_2,Keeps getting better still a little buggy,Im on an original iPad mini and so maybe that's part of he deal but it seems like there are still little thins that need some work For example the spell check doesn't work just right and the search is slow at times Neither of these or any others will keep from giving this app a great rating I also think that here are improvements I hope to see in the future One is full screen mode Maybe I'm missing this but the only time you get full screen is when you start a new note I'd like this options when reading or editing too Keep up the good work 
99_4526_2,Horrible,The Evernote desktop version effectively ruined my windows 7 computer and brought to a halt my MS Office especially outlook Still trying to repair the effects of this program Sadly haven't even got to really use the program If you use a Mac then maybe no issues but it was a bad purchase for this windows computer user

99_4541_2,Scanner,It's great when it works the app disconnects frequently 
99_4542_2,Please patch for future updates,In a previous version if the user was looking at pictures and suspended the app it would leave it right where they were upon restarting the app Now the app completely refreshes at start up which gets annoying sometimes Also its more cumbersome to swipe through images since it's only responsive on the top half of the screen instead of the whole screen
99_4543_2,problem discovery,Fix some prblms
99_4544_2,problem discovery,Full stars if completely downloaded Not downloading properly although full netwrk excess
99_4545_2,Crashes when I select INFO ,This is a very beautiful app and worthy of ever cent The only thing is my app crashes every time I try to select for info for a planet Maybe it is because the brand new iOS 4 NEEDS AN UPDATE

99_4550_2,Great app for finding local gems,We really enjoy this app while traveling When you're on the road and you're ready to stop to eat this is a great app to find a good place We have found some really good places to eat that we would not have known about Having a map to get you there also helps One small issue I have is that when you ask what's near you or when you use a filter not everything shows up An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel It didn't show up on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location it didn't show up in the search But when I searched by name there was the pub and reviews

99_4574_2,Please clear the un starred files,Non starred files occupied more than 600 MB and I have no way to reduce itit eats out all my ipad space
99_4575_2,Better but still needs work,I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version The in game display is better organized and the Scores page is vastly superior to the prior version you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list After a modest amount of use the app appears much more stable However it still needs work in many respects The scoring summary is gone so far as I can tell I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play by play The team leaders appears limited to only 1 QB passing 1 player rushing and 2 receivers with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing Especially during the preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages this is very frustrating there's no way for example to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time A more egregious problem is that at least for the Thursday games in week 2 the teams do not switch properly checking on the Atlanta vs Cincinnati game if I tap on the Atlanta Falcons button I get the passing stats for A Dalton if i tap on the Cincinnati button I see the passing stats for M Ryan with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly but it reflects poorly on the product I apologize for the comments length I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback 
99_4576_2,Great software despite the new web interface,I love Evernote and I use it everywhere and on various devices iOS and desktop I used to love the simplicity of the web interface but the new one seems too cumbersome and I've had some really weird issues where it has overwritten my notes Overall I would rate the environment 45
99_4577_2,TripAdvisor Censors,I have tried to get information on TA and all I see is this statement that the review has been removed What gives At this rate TA is of no use to me
99_4578_2,Dropbox app now useless,Can no longer add files directly from phone Completely loses point for me now Won't use it until I see an update
99_4579_2,Bug is latest ver,Evernote has been a mainstay in my life for the past years and it pains me to say that there's a major bug in current ver Once I get into webview I'm unable to go back to Evernote The Done button is not working I tried quoting the app and it won't work either Now I'm re downloading the app cross fingers this will help
99_4580_2,Awesome,I am totally addicted to this this is my only app that I have from so long ago only one tiny problem it does freeze but only once in a blue moon so it doesnt really bother me 1 best app I am up to level 101 NO JOKE 
99_4581_2,Fix this issue please,Was I the only one to ever report this problem Ever since I downloaded the latest update the app on my iPad continues to show a pop up alert message I click ok and it pops right back up I've turned off all alerts for the app and I have been in contact with Apple Support We reset to complete default mode reloaded the app and still the issue It is so annoying Is any else experiencing this 
99_4582_2,not liking this app anymore,I loved SoundHound before the last update Now I can't view my history I've tried several times and after 30 minutes of waiting for it to download I just give up Back to using Shazam I hope this gets fixed 
99_4583_2,Slow and buggy,Please fix the crashes bugs and if its possible make the App faster
99_4584_2,Usually very reliable,Until the last update Please fix
99_4585_2,problem discovery,Good This app can be improved if there was a option to select it as a default camera 
99_4586_2,Seat Selection,Every time I try to select a seat it never loads 
99_4587_2,Last update down grade,The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders But you are not able to make folders inside folders I wish you could The bad things about the last update Now typing has lag which is very annoying I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard But now i wish it was back up top at least Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard

99_4592_2,File names illegible,This is not a review of the Dropbox service which is great but of this app which can use a lot of improvements The single most frustrating thing about it is that it displays only a dozen or so characters in a file name Since I have thousands of files some with long and descriptive names it is impossible to find what I'm looking for unless I download the files to the iPad one by one There is no way to resize the file list to make more of the files visible Why not 
99_4593_2,Annoyed,I love Dropbox on my Mac and I use it all the time to share files with my photography clients However I find it very annoying I cannot email the link to my clients in the iPhone app Makes it hard for on the go sharing What's the point of the app if I cannot share my folders Please change

99_4642_2,New update ,The new update doesn't work Won't even open now Can't believe I paid for this app I have found better apps for free 
99_4643_2,Update bad,Crashes after update

99_4645_2,Horrible update,I can't even install it I am now with out my navigation This is the worst Hurry up and fix it and I will change it to an 4 star
99_4646_2,Very good app,Does everything I would need a simple weather app to do Radar is slow to load but I have another app for that There's not a lot of detail in the information particularly in details for upcoming days The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day Nevertheless this isn't meant to be too detailed and it provides plenty of info for the current time My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often Sometimes it will load the second time sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation It's a nice looking app the kind that you would want to have on your iPad it just has a stability problem 
99_4647_2,There is no way to move edited photos to iPhoto on Mac ,After you edit the photos on the iPad there is no way to move them to the iPhoto app on a Mac They don't update on the Mac Please fix this

99_4651_2,Terrible,The only thing this is good for is starting documents If you try to upload your documents from google documents the document is just gray 
99_4652_2,Went from great to unusable,This once great app is now useless Every address I enter fails I was a faithful and constant user before the update now I am searching for another app that actually works 
99_4653_2,Where's My SkyCaddie ,I have the paid 20 00 version Worked great until update Seriously nothing works now Greens are not tee boxes and swimming pools are not greens 
99_4654_2,brown rice,Will definitely download and re rate as 5 stars when this is fixed Unusable if you want that option which is why I give 1 star Dont bother putting brown rice in the special secrion as it may be missed Great way to order and avoid any miscommunication with staff Love the food a ton 
99_4655_2,App won't open,I downloaded this app so I could load my physical card and take advantage of the 10 free offer but the app won't open I've rebooted my phone and deleted and reinstalled the app No luck Was there any quality control on this thing 
99_4656_2,Recent update crashes,This app was great until the most recent update Now it crashes all the time Do NOT download until this problem is hopefully fixed 
99_4657_2,Cool,It is the best app ever 
99_4658_2,wow way to kill a potentially great app ,First off let me say that it looks great if I could get it to stay up for more than 5 seconds then it CRASHES The concept is wonderful and the app appears to be very nicely done from a user interface standpoint but it is very unstable Big disappointment since I use this for my doctoral studies major failure in the mobility and convenience categories 0 out of 10 for usefulness 
99_4659_2,Opted out,I was using the app which seemed great until I noticed it was posting to my fb page even though I opted out Deleted app because it doesn't give you the option again after the fact
99_4660_2,Fix this app,Every time I use it it crashes If I don't use for 25 days pinger says they will give away my number Terrible app 
99_4661_2,Freezes during payment processing,The app is fine but the one thing and really only thing you need it for isn't working I attempted to pay a bill using the credit card already on file and after several minutes of beach ball froze the app I had to go to the website to pay my bill 
99_4662_2,Great app but constantly freezes,This is just do frustrating Only solution is Delete and re download app Then it freezes again on camera launch Happened for the last month Please fix it then I will Gladly give all Five stars 
99_4663_2,Fun game but errors,Very fun but the server is apparently not that big for all users My app keeps getting errors when I try to open it and play where I don't get that with other games Haven't been able to play all day
99_4664_2,Game won't load ,Very aggravating First game wouldn't load just got loading spinner Now game will load for 1 play then when you try to play again black screen loading spinner Waste of money Please fix it 
99_4665_2,Horrible update,Ever since iOS 7 update Dropbox has not worked constantly crashes when it does run it is EXTREMELY slow and there are problems with camera uploading PLEASE FIX ASAP
99_4666_2,Dropbox not working,Since the update it won't backup to Dropbox
99_4667_2,Why not support previous IOS ,I have an ipad 1st gen which can not update anymore I want to install dropbox on that device but dropbox can not be installed I hate it Why not support the previous IOS version How can we use it 
99_4668_2,Crash,My iPad works fine when I open Dropbox But every time I open it on my iPhone 4 is either crashes or it continuously pulls up a messiah making it hard to close It needs to fixed Fast Even after the current update just a day ago it is still crashing on IPhone This needs to be fixed
99_4669_2,Bugs ,I care more about the functionality than the looks so this review will say nothing about the updated look There are some major bugsproblems with the update I am no longer given the option to 'open in' This means I can look at my Numbers spreadsheets but I can't 'open in' Numbers so I can't work with those spreadsheets or enter any info on them Major issue It makes dropbox completely useless for me Please fix this 
99_4670_2,Bring back colored icons,This update makes it harder and slower to use The icons for different file types all look very similar which makes it slower to scan through and find the desired file The old version used colors which made it much faster to use
99_4671_2,whiteout horrid on iPad,The inverted colors of the icon induce retinal after images and in app the whiteout is hard on the eyes The experience on an iPad Air is one of huge expanses of white or badly contrasting off whitelight blue and stencil thin pale icons battling the brightness of it all The spartan look works fine on an iPhone where there is proportionately less white assaulting the eye with the iPad however I keep trying to reduce the brightness of the display but that only further impacts contrast and legibility Also why is it not possible to change names of files or folders 
99_4672_2,Can't open JPEG with new update,Since they did a new update almost all my JPEG take too much time to open or even don't open I need to save the file to see the photo on my iPhone How can I have the old version 
99_4673_2,Maximization,HOW CAN I CAN MAXIMIZE THE SLIDE SHOW IT DISAPPEARED BAD UPDATE
99_4674_2,Doesn't work on iPad,When I open it crashes my iPad
99_4675_2,Downloads of favorites can't resume ,Im on a crappy hotel wifi that goes in and out Been trying to download a 1gb file for over 2 days now But for some reason dropbox has not allowed favorited downloads the ability to resume and instead restarts the download from the beginning every time it fails It's almost 2014 We have the technology to RESUME A DOWNLOAD what's the problem here 
99_4676_2,Fix the starred items feature ,It does a poor job at retaining the starred items in memory So I wait a long time for an MP3 to buffer I 'star' it so I won't have to wait next time But then next time it often has to buffer all over again 
99_4677_2,Ok,Needs to be less crazy
99_4678_2,Could be better,Music takes 15 seconds to load after you have selected a song doesn't matter if I'm on Verizon LTE or Wifi also it doesn't play the next song automatically instead you have to open the app go back and pick the next song in the folder You can't even hit the 'next' button to skip tracks Please fix these in the next update Running iOS7 Same issues on iOS 6
99_4679_2,It's stupid,You can't download any videos into your phone Like come on I don't know why yahoo would do this to me making a deal with Dropbox
99_4680_2,iPad app crashes,I typically don't leave support as my feedback but I can't seem to get a response This app crashes each and every time I try to open it on my iPad 3rd gen I use it often on my Iph5 but for some reason here it doesn't work Please update ASAP so it works again
99_4681_2,Not universal,It works on a few platforms but I love to keep changing my phones every couple of weeks and this app is not universal on all platforms They need to release this app on more platforms like newer Windows Phone 8 like Lumia 1020 and then it will be true 5 stars Till then sky drive wins
99_4682_2,Great app Beware of newest version,Always loved Dropbox Reliable and handy Newest version has menu problems Can't upload Please fix Thanks 
99_4683_2,Please fix,I'm having issues with moving my files
99_4684_2,App does work,I install Dropbox yesterday When I start the App the dialog box ' app wants your location' appears in an endless loop
99_4685_2,Can't use,I have not been able to use Please fix
99_4686_2,Don't update,New update doesn't detail what's changed Now the app doesn't work Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom Please fix soon
99_4687_2,Doesn't work on iPad mini,I get a pop up about push notifications and if I push ok it pops back up again making it completely inoperable I tried changing all the push notification options and it doesn't fix it 
99_4688_2,App fails to install can't update either,This app never installed correctly I don't see the icon Nevertheless it always show up in the App Store under Updates It always says Installing I can't update it can't delete it can't use it Only App I've ever seen that does that ZERO stars What a Joke 
99_4689_2,Frozen Screen,Spent many hours successfully transporting pictures Site then froze when I needed to export All pictures are locked and frozen I keep trying to re access the app site with no success
99_4690_2,need to fix ,somethings wrong with the last update i only can view pdfs once after opening for the first time cannot view them anymore the latest update fixed the issue of crashes and also can view the pdfs without problem thanks a lot for your work however there is still a problem which is that when you try using the 'open in' option in other iPad applications and ask to open in Dropbox the filed just opened shows up in the iPad Dropbox application but the Dropbox server is not updated meaning that file is not found in the Dropbox folders if you access the folders in a different devicecomputer etc
99_4691_2,App is missing,Downloaded the latest update and now my app has disappeared and the App Store won't let me download it again
99_4692_2,It keeps sayin updating,I can't open the goddamn app
99_4693_2,Crashing Help ,I can't open it on my ipad 3 Help Crash Crash Crash 
99_4694_2,App Crashes,Thanks Dropbox Here I was thinking Dropbox is one of the greatest inventions since sliced bread One update and I can't access my files or photos on my gen 3 IPad I know it is Presidents' Day weekend but can someone fix this please Maybe you are enjoying time with familysure would be nice to share pics with them
99_4695_2,Rubbish,Cannot open any saved files
99_4696_2,nightmare,The automatic upload feature is ridiculous as there is no intuitive or easy way to stop it Also the delete function is confusing and should have some sort of dialog box informing you that you are about to delete a photo on your ipad not just in dropbox interface and ask you to confirm that you want to do this My wife tried to stop the automatic upload and hit the delete prompt thinking that may stop it We now lost photos of our newborn which we cannot recover Thank you Dropbox you just lost us photos we will never get back 
99_4697_2,App Fails on 411KB upload,The latest revision as of 10 January 2013 loops endlessly when trying to upload a 411KB file Had to email it to move to another device
99_4698_2,Reconsidering,Update EN performance has improved considerably from 2 to 3 stars since my last review however the app remains pretty buggy It constantly reports failure to synch it freezes momentarily between all actions it crashes here and thee and the search function sometimes fails to find key words I am borderline thinking of going premium but also keeping an eye for alternatives Note some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7 Previous review After several months of daily use and building about 1K pretty intensive notes I was in the process to put a serious long term commitment to EN but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week in terms of less freezes when trying to do a search so for me it is wait and see to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN but will also be on stand by and looking for possible alternatives I don't have many concerns w the new design as others do but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues
99_4699_2,Dec 12 Update Crashes App,I love Evernote and have become very reliant on it one of the apps I can't do without however I am without it now because it crashes on open and will not open on iPhone DO NOT load the Dec 12 update Evernote please fix
99_4700_2,Freezes,The app has been unbelievably buggy since the last update Cannot trust using it on iPhone only desktop and iPad 
99_4701_2,EverCrash,Brilliant app but crashes on iPad and iPhone
99_4702_2,Dislike this update ,I dislike the latest version My notes randomly disappear They are listed under the wrong name usually by the one that is actually above it I LOVED the version prior to this one This version is making me lose my confidence that my notes are actually being saved 
99_4703_2,Progressively pretty functionally worse,Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I'm happy to be a premium subscriber The mobile app however seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements ' which are essentially ads now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work I'd subscribe I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration though this feature causes a crash Arg I'm an Evernote evangelist but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app ORIGINAL REVIEW Thanks for your hard work Happy to be a premium subscriber Only suggestion add ability to copy note links
99_4704_2,Can't trust it,I really wanted a note system I could trust but Evernote just lost all my notes on the upgrade
99_4705_2,Very poor design,It seems Evernote did not understand the spirit of iOS 7 The design seems flat for the sake of flatness Usability has been thrown out the door It's very confusing to use the app Simple actions are painfully slow
99_4706_2,I give up,Okay Evernote I hope you are listening You had a great idea But 'note' should not be in your name Call it Eversomething The text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text bullets numbered lists indentation etc Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting I don't know but until this is fixed it is not useful And man I've really tried to like Evernote The synching ability among so many platforms was great But I have to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you will read this But I really wish you would understand this huge weakness in your product And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities Please fix this I really want need a proper Evernote 
99_4707_2,Needs fixing,The search function isn't working and I have to sign in every time I open it Evernote needs to fix this Other than that I love Evernote
99_4708_2,Oops,Was just beginning to trust this app until 7 update Quit working for all practical purposes Will watch for patches and post an updated review I really was wanting this app to be effective They have some silly new process to sell post it notes Not 
99_4709_2,iOS 7 glitches, The highlighting of words works but the menu that pops up to copy cut paste etc Won't stay open long enough to be used When placing the cursor over text when the keyboard is open makes the text jump every where but where you want the cursor to be
99_4710_2,BROKEN,No notes showing up All the notebooks are there but they are all empty Boo
99_4711_2,Lovehate,Seems like the Evernote religion has passed me by Perhaps there are handy tools that I am missing trainings that are obvious to all but me But really The notes bullet points spacing numbering all fail when i transfer to Word and other systems The resulting formatting problems take longer than just starting over and retyping notes I also find that the left column flickers and the program crashes at every other use About 1 in 4 syncs give an error message All that aside I like calling up notes on my phone ipad and desktop almost whenever I want If this problematic version is intended to induce me to go for another version it doesn't In fact if this version were more solid I'd be tempted to buy the upgrade
99_4712_2,Problems syncing and opening notes,When this app worked I'd give it 4 stars But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync And then I couldn't open all my notes And now it says trouble reaching evernote server Btw the solution to that 1 after I tried reinstalling and rebooting is to log in using user name instead of email or vice versa Whatever you're having a problem w try the other But annoying this happens at all If it works for you this is a pretty good app to help you keep all those notes you scribble down and email yourself in 1 place
99_4713_2,HORRIBLE UPDATE ,Today's update dated March 1 2013 is horrible Every single time I open up the App it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then when I select either 'Title' which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes in alphabetical order or I select 'Created ' the App immediately crashes and closes I have tried this over 50 times I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail I tried deleting the App all together and then reloaded it but still the same problem This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created and even each month is not in alphabetical order THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE I have always been one of your biggest advocates and proponents If this bug isn't fixed pronto I will have to delete Evernote permanently and use a different App ARGHHHHHH 
99_4714_2,Saved button is missing,I was looking for the longest time the save Favorites feature button until I noticed that it only appears when iPad is hold in vertical position upright This was so weird I usually hold my iPad for trip advisor in horizontal position sideways so the button was nowhere to be found I hope that the tripadvisor fixes this UX usability issue soon
99_4715_2,Was greatnow crashes,Was an excellent app Now crashes on iPod touch since last update Won't open at all Please fix asap 
99_4716_2,DO NOT RELY ON TA MAPS,Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong or maybe a mislabeled street but I am seeing much worse locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area Want to golf Go horseback riding Come to the historic Centro where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house Next problem related to this is the 'Near Me' function First the app couldn't find me Instead it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house Lastly the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed I am definitely unhappy with this version
99_4717_2,This Website is a Fraud,Most of the hotel reviews especially from poor hotels are fake and most likely posted by employees Notice how after a negative review is posted it is invariably followed by several glowing reviews And because TripAdvisor is paid by the hotels listed on this site they will remove negative reviews if pressured by the hotel
99_4718_2,Please fix bug,I love this app It helps me a lot when I'm on the trip but one thing that makes me mad that when I click to see the photos It's only show 1 pic and I got stuck I have to delete the app and redownload it again 
99_4719_2,No Saved Trips,Unable to save forum posts that are the most useful suggestions when out on a trip No Saved Trips that you personally put together to assist you when out about with your mobile What good is that Not many will find a wifi and open their laptop

99_4726_2,problem discovery,Great app Occasionally freezes or has errors loading pinning I have also had issues refreshing feed at timesbut otherwise great app
99_4727_2,problem discovery,Confusing If you have never used Pintrest it is confusing Now they have a new mapping thing that you have to say if you want to use every pin Also pops up for you to rate it at every log in so save yourself the annoyance and rate it right away
99_4728_2,problem discovery,Keeps telling me to reset my password because it is in safe mode but will not send me the email to do so

99_4735_2,No preview,Older versions of this app used to allow me to preview word excel and pdf documents While the preview pane is still there the app just tells me the file name and size and does NOT display the content Completely useless

99_4756_4,rating,Seriously needed permissions I think not Why in the world would I give anyone or application the right to make phone calls through my phone edit my text messages and send them take video and pictures This is sadly getting worse with each update and this is supposed to be a security program I was pleased at first with this app but have no respect for it or the idiots coming up with these updates This needs to stop Next you will need to access my credit report Here's an idea DELETED

99_4783_4,rating,Rip off What comes basic in most quality editors this app wants us to buy at up to 2 each totalling over 30 00 what a rip off It doesn't even have hue which I use more then any other filter Highly dissatisfied There are hundreds of editors in the play store plus most phones come with one that's fairly decent hit share to find yours Uninstalled

99_4789_4,rating,I want my money back The one thing I hate about it always doesn't work it works when it wants to apps should be 99 cents instead of three dollars I don't think it's worth 3 I recommend you do not buy it unless you have money to waste 
99_4790_4,rating,a a
99_4791_4,rating,Good Good aps
99_4792_4,rating,Costs too much and too many add ons Despite its many options I've had experienced many issues with this product It has crashed quite a few times already in the last two days moreover why do I have to pay so much for 'add ons' that should be standard such as fonts and dictionary This just shows the developer is being too greedy In addition it seems to be very slow on my nexus 10
99_4793_4,rating,Abysmal controls and AI repetitive campaign Fun game abysmal controls and AI Why on earth team 17 opted for touch controls instead of virtual arrows or a d pad I have no idea Now the AI uses grenades or bazooka about 90 percent of the time with absolute perfection Calculating wind speeds and never missing a single shot even if it is necessary to shoot in the complete opposite direction and rely solely on wind Please make it more human and make it use the other weapons a lot more often Plus the campaign is just skirmish no actual missions 
99_4794_4,rating,Nice I like it
99_4795_4,rating,Awkward menus I bought this app quickly attempted to do my most common types of formatting and found it very slowly and fiddly on my note 2 Much better on the BlackBerry So as quickly as I could I attempt to un install and get a refund can't So am I stuck 
99_4796_4,rating,AVG Tried and tried and tried to use the AVG find my phone part of this app Didn't find it once just kept saying try later so I did and kept on trying I paid for this app so I kind of expect it to work Not enough to the app either Dull to use looks Dull and had I not paid for it I would delete in a heart beat 
99_4797_4,rating,Lacks features and options
99_4798_4,rating,Good Nice 
99_4799_4,rating,yo yo
99_4800_4,rating,Bisso Pp
99_4801_4,rating,Not horrible but All in all it's in the tradition of the franchise In campaign mode it's pretty annoying that the AI never misses and the wind is always exactly what it needs to hit 
99_4802_4,rating,Ehhh Every level after 19 is ridiculously hard The enemy worms take hardly any damage and seem to aim perfectly through the tiniest spaces while your worms die by 1st or 2nd turn leaving you with 1 worm against 8 or 9 I'm ready to uninstall
99_4803_4,rating,Specs fail I noticed the same on my note 2 it says tht i have dual core 
99_4804_4,rating,Grt Gud
99_4805_4,rating,Android Very nice app
99_4806_4,rating,Same old worms terrible controls The developer has opted for the classic tap either side of the screen to move and drag the reticle to aim touch control system it does not support controller or keyboard input The result is a control system that is borderline unresponsive and makes fine movement or fast movement completely inefficient This game is so tedious to play it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it If you bought this during the sale you got a great deal but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17 I'm disappointed in this lackluster port Overall the game is a great example of what can happen to a great idea when it's executed poorly I am however happy to give Team 17 a few extra dollars and hope they make improvements over time 
99_4807_4,rating,Money ripping I have played this game on pc and realised it was released for android platform As soon as i downloaded it and payed for it it is ridiculous that they are still charging so much money for other mini games available in the game Really disappointed with this Please resolve this issue n i'll give this game a 5 star

99_4823_4,rating,Old is Better
99_4824_4,rating,There was a time for this app The fact that the app needs me to register after I have paid for it sucks The fact that it makes me do it with no way of turning it off other than hitting later every time it updates is a deal breaker Get a 365 account and use Microsoft's full version of office 
99_4825_4,rating,In need of an update You guys have done nothing to improve what started out as a good thing decent app with lazy devs

99_4939_4,rating,Pretty Good I give it three stars because there's alot of photo editing apps that already have the same features for free you'll get that fifth star whenever the clone effect is added but it's pretty good but no better than the FREE apps with these same effects 
99_4940_4,rating,Ghh
99_4941_4,rating,Lots of fun Wish the hair edit wasn't so vibrant And the lower half of face doesn't get much change when brightening the face 
99_4942_4,rating,Good stuff This app would be better if the draw function had the same beautiful brushes as Line Brush However the eyedropper tool ability to change opacity and hardness of brush tools and more make this photo editing app a good one I haven't updated however after reading the latest reviews 
99_4943_4,rating,Great game Love the gameplay

99_4975_4,rating,The best one suggestion I'd love to see an option for TRUE black and white saves not just an option for high contrast greyscale That way CCITT compression could be used and the space saving would be dramatic 90 percent of my scans would be fine in high rez 1 bit I've yet to see another app that can save to 1 bit though they can be read by most PDF viewers but given storage size concerns I don't see why scan apps don't include this as an option Great job on all the rest though

99_5172_4,rating,Like Awesome
99_5173_4,rating,Great app easy to use This app has completely surpassed my expectations It is extremely easy to use has a nice interface and let's you produce a wide variety of collages 
99_5174_4,Great Fun,This game is really fun and a great way to learn facts geography capitals landmarks and locations of all of the great states in the United States My nephews are into strategically placing the stacks Super learning fun 
99_5175_4,Awesome ,I love how it tests my brain 
99_5176_4,Worth every penny ,You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free I thought the same thing and finally ponied up do you really spend that much more less on a cup of coffee and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable Time tables are pretty accurate but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab Has saved me so much in time 
99_5177_4,Works great,Easy to find songs and purchase in iTunes 
99_5178_4,Awesome app,Having fun I never had much interest in astronomy but this app has changed everything 
99_5179_4,Great app ,Lots of fun to use We live in a unpopulated area and it's neat to pick out which stars are what The app works very well 
99_5180_4,Revue,It's really useful cuz I'm a astronomer It's magestical 
99_5181_4,Awesome,A very exciting app I like to share with my kids 
99_5182_4,Saweeeet',Very nice app
99_5183_4,Local Eats,Great info on Houston restaurants though some restaurant info needs to be updated such as those which have relocated 
99_5184_4,The best restaurant finding app,The only complaint I have about this app is that unless you live in one of the supported cities it's pretty much useless Even if you do live in a big city the app won't help you at all if you're travelling somewhere smaller which is why I recommend keeping a backup app like Urbanspoon on your iPhone as a backup 
99_5185_4,Nice program quick support ,I bought this app on December 24th I purchased mainly for hunting and the Google terrain map set I had issued where the terrain map would not load and was blacked out All other maps and features worked fine I emailed customer support that night around 11pm and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am Christmas morning Now that's what I would consider excellent support Seems there was a small issue with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd and Saturday the 24th I am all fixed up now and everything works great 
99_5186_4,Great app super useful,I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time I strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app 
99_5187_4,Wow what a great update ,I cannot believe how amazing the new changes are If you mountain bike hike camp or travel this is a must need app It now tracks altitude pace speed and about every other stat you need in any unit of measure By far this is the best app I have 
99_5188_4,Good app,Pretty easy to use been using it for over 2 years Easy to learn As new features were added those features made sense 
99_5189_4,Love love love ,This is hands down the most useful app I had the lite version but decided it was worth the money to upgrade It makes it so much easier than the guess and check on the calendar I love it 
99_5190_4,Photographer,Ran side by side with other and this app beat all hands down Needs dedicated space for mileage 
99_5191_4,Great app,Love it's multifunctionality Able to do multiple business and year prior expenses etc 
99_5192_4,Consumer,This ap is great really puts your collection at your fingertips I really like how easy it is to manage your wine collection buying drinking or storage notes Love it 
99_5193_4,Great app ,Works awesome for me Have 1200 cellar of mostly older bottles Scan works a lot but type and search fills in Really live off this app love the drink now feature Use that every week 
99_5194_4,The best,Better than any other wine app 
99_5195_4,Ehh,It is a good app but I eat a lot of home cooked meals and it's hard to find the exact thing I ate 
99_5196_4,Amazing,This app is beast The best thing is is that it doesn't need Internet Because I have an iPod touch so I don't have Internet on it in public I recomend this app 
99_5197_4,Great app,Buy it
99_5198_4,I like,This is a great little app especially for those with hectic schedules it keeps you in like for visual people like me 
99_5199_4,Support my touch ,Live sky does not work on my touch Also doesn't find my correct locAtion So close to being like the Droid app but off by a parsec 
99_5200_4,One of my few must have apps ,I keep tabs on my brother's flight info as he travels for work quite a bit I'm a worrier by nature so it's wonderful to be able to see the progress of his flights I've always been able to pull them up easily they've always been accurate Great job 
99_5201_4,Great app ,Used this app all over the world and it hasn't let me down yet 
99_5202_4,Snow n sun,I take this on the mountain and on the bike trail Continually improving in surprising ways Keep up the great work 
99_5203_4,Pure joy,It's a pure joy already having a pic when your friends call and sometimes contacts info from your FB friends that you haven't taken the time out to acquire Fabulous 
99_5204_4,Love it ,I love the sync bday reminders 
99_5205_4,No complaints,Works just fine 
99_5206_4,Awesomeness ,Great app 
99_5207_4,Works great with iPad,Now that it comes with iPad Keynote integration this app is worthwhile to get My only complaint is that notifications on the iPad interrupt it Which you can fix Apple by improving the notification system cough So get this if you use Keynote 
99_5208_4,Instructions on how to use ,To those concerned that you cannot zoom in on those savvy charts and reference materials included on this app you CAN Let me help Simply tap on the chart or image itself This will then immediately bring it up closer in its own page and then you can get even closer by pinching Just tap the images first my friends This is a great app 
99_5209_4,Boss,At first I didn't have the challenges on and literally got board in about 10min But when I turn the challenges on I was all over it like a hawk of a dead animal So to get to the point BETER THAN MODERN COMBAT 3 
99_5210_4, 3,BEST GAME EVER 
99_5211_4,How to buy packs,I can't find how to buy add ons Plz help other wise great game
99_5212_4,Add girls ,I will give it 5 stars when you add girl pygmies 
99_5213_4,Love this App,Great app to have for tracking flights I own a limousine company all my drivers use it to track their clients flights 
99_5214_4,Great ,Easy to use and very accurate A must for any traveler 
99_5215_4,Amazing ,I just finished up a weekend of playing and it was the first time I have used this product I was more than impressed with it The setlist option was my favorite part We played several different times throughout the weekend and being able to program the songs into setlist form made it super easy to transition between songs I highly recommend this product and can't wait to use it again 
99_5216_4,Easy to use even for non techie Well worth the price ,A must buy 
99_5217_4,Awesome,For the price it's great I've been using quicken for 5 years now but I've switched to this app 2 years ago My wife and I use the sync option and are now keeping a budge very easily Awesome app needs a desktop version 
99_5218_4,The future is now,This app is a fixture in my college studies Good Reader technology turbo charges my research and puts me ahead of the pack I couple it with Instapaper papers and an air printer app or two and the power is in my hands and pocket 
99_5219_4,Great app,I use this app every day on my iPhone 4 and it works perfectly fine 
99_5220_4,Love photos with Bible verses ,I enjoy sending verses to my friends on my iPhone
99_5221_4,Love it ,I love having a new verse pop up every morning Great for on the go and if you're looking for a verse pertaining to a certain category whether it be encouragement patience etc Very convenient And beautiful background pictures 
99_5222_4,So useful for keeping me in track ,I love the convenience I having daily readings right at my fingertips and when I travel to Europe for the semester I don't know if I could live without it 
99_5223_4,IMissal,Great for daily readings I love it 
99_5224_4,Excellent app ,This is an excellent app to use in the daily devotional reading of the mass readings Well done 
99_5225_4,Great app,Overall a great app I use it daily It would be helpful if entrance and communion antiphons were included I do not appreciate the new in app purchase feature The saint of the day should either be included with the program or have a way to remove the buy button for those who do not want to purchase this 
99_5226_4,A Wonderful Spiritual Aid,What a bargain for all the benefits I receive daily from this app The audio is especially good to have Reading or listening to the daily Mass readings has been a great help to me I also like having the prayers for the start and end my day I consider this to be a must have app for all busy Catholics 
99_5227_4,Like a boss,Doodle jump is sick I love it He's so freaking cute 
99_5228_4,Awesome with Quizlet ,I needed a good flash card system for my Mandarin vocabulary and this is everything I could have asked for If never heard of Quizlet before but by enabling the extended keyboard for pinyin and my Simplified Chinese keyboard I was easily able to make a custom list of words shu on one side and water on the other for instance Inputting them to this app was super easy Very well done and totally worth the 4 Quizlet is free by the way 
99_5229_4,Buy this,Pixel for pixel this scanner does better than an expensive HP printer scanner Part of that is the iPhone but the other part is JotNot's software I use this in my presentations for text off a page it doesn't do so well with images though hence the 4 stars taken as a whole it's money well spent

99_5253_4,Not one problem with this app,I love this app nothing better for the NASCAR fan 
99_5255_4,Great app for this price,I have been using this product for 5 days and I love it If you are seeking for an app mainly to write school paper do basic spreadsheet and reading PDF articles this is the one Of course you can't compare to iWork apps because they will definitely beat this app in terms of looks and quality called great marketing But if you are a poor student like me paying student loans and are seeking for an app mainly to write papers and read docs I recommend with this one I have not tried the PowerPoint yet so I can't say much about it 
99_5256_4,Mr,I love it
99_5257_4,Not that good,Got this app to be able to share PPT and Word docs Does not support all of the data from those files Not happy with it at all Will try to work with it but I think it was a waste of time and money 
99_5258_4,Great,Great 
99_5259_4,soaring hawk,great app

99_5261_4,VERY WELL,VERY WELL
99_5262_4,A ,Great app Works on almost any course No complaints at all 
99_5263_4,Great golf app,Overall fantastic The UI is a little clunky and things like tapping in the golf ball icon to measure club distance were a little tough to find It doesn't look like a button Wish I could view the clubs and look at their performance without starting a round Statistics could use some work as well The charts while fairly easy to read seem disjointed Needs a better social aspect 
99_5264_4,Now with in app stats , Update 149 rounds recorded iPhone 3GS Battery 70 80 left after rounds Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that Finally fivesomes Sixsomes THE BEST APP FOR GOLF 17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy The new in app stats v 1 3 blew me away Still waiting for side games skins etc I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball usually while I'm 20 30 yards away I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep After putting I whip it out score the entire foursome takes about 15 seconds total and then put it back to sleep I consistently have 80 85 battery life after my round is complete Once we get side games betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever It's accurate easy to use and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted but now I can't live without Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble 
99_5265_4,Best Golf GPS for the money,I have used this App for over 8 months and is by far the best golf GPS for the money I had a sky caddie before and it was not half as good as this app Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units buy this app and have everything you need I have the iPhone 4 and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1 2 to 5 1 2 hour round Turn off your Wi fi if it is using more battery life than that Anyway must have for all serious golfers 
99_5266_4,Used nearly every day,This app while not perfect some songs it doesn't is very good I use it severalvtimes a week 
99_5267_4,Great,I use this every night It amazes me how little sleep I get most nights I have made sleeping more of a priority since using it I can see the difference

99_5280_4,Outstanding ,Recently used in several European cities and it was GREAT 
99_5281_4,I like I like,Well I have used Magellan it was cool and then I bought a navigon that was the biggest waste of 350 dollars of my life then I used sprint navigation that was fairly accurate so there I have had a couple and this is one of my favorite navigation devices the huge difference is the price 99 cents can't be beaten Update to a month and a half later I love this navigation devise have used it more than my factory one I can listen to my music while navigating and it's points of interests rock The turn by turn speech and real time traffic is long gone but I don't miss it at all If I could give this app more stars I would
99_5282_4,needs a few more tweeks,good app but to make it a great app video would be a great feature A must need is to make the timer continuous After the 5 sec countdown it would be great for it to restart automatically for continuous self shots Please add that 
99_5283_4,Drudge review,The best news I always check Drudge first for the rest of the story 
99_5284_4,Works great,Smooth simple app

99_5296_4,Best calculator ever ,A well engineered multipurpose calculator If the extensive template library doesn't have what you need you can easily create your own calculators without a steep learning curve As a repeat customer since the Palm handheld days I definitely consider this a great value Keep up the good work 
99_5297_4,A most useful tool ,I find that this app does exactly what I wanted it to do display meaningful data from all the iPhone sensors Very clear and intuitive interface It's really the only tool of it's type I need 
99_5298_4,Wonderful ,Very nice looking app 
99_5299_4,Too too cool ,My only complaint with this otherwise wonderful app is the absence of any warning for the bottomless hole in time this thing hides If you are not very careful you will fall into this hole which isn't marked in any fashion by a navigation tool that marks everything else and your family or friends may lose you Leave a note and tell them where you went and don't worry you'll meet thousands of new friends down in that hole Finally I wrote chatted with the guy who wrote this good man and thanks for this jewel

99_5426_4,Owner,Great app 
99_5427_4,Backcountryelkhunter,Works great Maps are good better than my Garmin Default is the lowest cache amount so make sure you turn up the cache amount so you don't find yourself without any maps when you lose service Make sure you scout your area with the maps you want before hunting so it will cache your map area for when you lose service you still can use your cached maps Best 5 bucks spent for those who want a good hunting GPS 
99_5428_4,Love this app,I love this app it is really handy when u r out in the woods
99_5429_4,One of the best iOS apps just got better ,The new release shows what a mature iOS app should look like It performs incredibly well while offering most features if not all that users could want Not only is it now offered at a lower price but there is an option to enhance the application with an upgrade Since few users need the enhancements it is a great way to offer them 
99_5430_4,Needs Retina Support,I've been using Marine Traffic for years online and on my iPhone Downloaded the iPad app and it's as simple good thing as always and the content is great I only give it 4 stars because it needs Retina support which would make it excellent 
99_5431_4,Great App ,Love the app use it all the time to check shipping activity in Puget Sound Helpful whether on land or on the water 
99_5432_4,Neat app,Great app 
99_5433_4,Day one,Really like this app It is a very easy way to journal
99_5434_4,Nice little niche,I have Day One on both my iOS devices and my Mac It just works beautifully seamlessly and smoothly Add simple photo function and you'll rule the journal app world Five star 
99_5435_4,Great app ,This is cool app I've used before but no search function I need it much 
99_5436_4,iPad,This app is awesome and makes recording everything so easy the only thing I can request is to make it compatible with iPads 
99_5437_4,Love it ,I have been a P 90 X client for some time now and love the workout With the P 90 X app I now have the option of taking my workout to the gym or with me when I travel Plus the nutrition journal makes it easier for me to keep track of what I eat during the day For me it is a great app Glad I purchased this app 
99_5438_4,Love this game ,I LOVE this game Please add more options like a curler and much more stuff I really want there to be a update PLEASE Oh and add MORE characters 
99_5439_4,Fun ,I love it it's fun to play on boring car rides 
99_5440_4,Great weather app,Great app for viewing weather 
99_5441_4,Good or Bad,It's as accurate as any weather forecaster who gets paid good money for often being 100 wrong So far this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately so who cares about too much scientific input I just don't want to be carrying an umbrella when the sun is shining 
99_5442_4,Awesome ,Best CL app I've ever used by far 
99_5443_4,Good app ,Easy to use

99_5447_4,Ay yo ,Works yo 
99_5448_4,Instagram,Awesome 
99_5449_4,Great App Gets Better ,This is a great app I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2 Each version is more refined I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version currently 'The Message' when I tap on the Scripture for the day This isn't the case with the iPhone app One always has to change the version from the default There are a couple formatting issue suggestions 1 The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row 2 One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner but there is no way to enlarge it One would think that a simple double tap could bring up the cover art full screen 3 When traveling I don't always have a wifi link so having issues cached is nice In those instances I simply use my Bible app or print version to get the Scripture for the day I don't expect or want ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway com on my device but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app Keep up the good work 
99_5450_4,Very useful,I have used this on countless occasions now It has come in handy and when I do use it the other party is as wowd as I was the first time I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky may be iPhone speech recognitions problems and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny But if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time Overall very pleased with this for just a buck 
99_5451_4,Amazing Must Have App,I am truly amazed at how well this app works the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that when I am recording my voice for translation IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS ME I have a very deep voice and I have never had any type of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the correct version I am very very very pleased with this app you should get it 
99_5452_4,Nice,The adjustments in Snapseed are very good and it's simple to learn and use However I'm not a fan The tools are very specific purpose and I find myself constantly moving back and forth from one limited purpose tool to another If you like a good sample of adjustments presented at one time in one place and on screen at all times Snapseed may not be what you're looking for 
99_5453_4,Awesome ,Best Post Edit App that I've tried to date Advanced features rival and even exceed that of Camera which I also love I did grab this free during a promo but even at 4 99 this ones worth the splurge 
99_5454_4,Yup,Solid but weird volume settings 
99_5455_4,Alarm Clock Review,Even better than the real thing

99_5491_4,Excellent App,Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet The reports are great Would love to be able to have main categories and sub categories That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand alone financial management app Keep up the good work 
99_5492_4,Great ,But make more apps People apple does not allow to open all apps directly only if the developer of app make it in code The launch of apps without safari is not possible An some apps possible but still not faster

99_5504_4,It works idiots ,Ok people this app works and if you are too stupid to figure out how to make something so simple work you shouldn't own a smart phone especially the iPhone The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the addition of all the contacts Looking forward to future updates 
99_5505_4,I can't believe this works so well,I never have to take a foreign language class again 
99_5506_4,ITranslator 1 0,Itranslater 1 0 is a good app but sometimes it dose't work out as you plan it to that is why I only rate it 4 stars rather than 5

99_5520_4,Thecentralscrutinizer,Daddy like 
99_5521_4,Well ,I love this app Its so easy to learn how to use it and its very easy to understand The only thing I don't like is that if you choose the option to show what the temp feels like you can't see what the temp actually is I would love to be able to see both at the same time

99_5547_4,Incredibly helpful ,This app is so fantastic I actually find it even better than the website It is easy to navigate easy to modify reservations There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar You can invite your co diners easily through the app it creates an email for you A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only by neighborhoods within a city by distance to you and so much more I use this app on a regular basis so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there It's such a great app and business that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it

99_5712_4,Heart,Particularly like the reminder 
99_5713_4,Accurate,Accurate
99_5714_4,Didn't work consistently,Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4 I was able to get it to work three times And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate as the dial moves around and then restarts constantly Sometimes a blinking heart shows up The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85 and then 31 Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs same spot It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app Seems to work for some people and not for others Doesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting

99_5823_4,I want to know how many targets I have hit so far ,I love the Brave version better than the original The graphics are much better and I love the phrases she says The objective of hitting 100 is stupid when I don't know how I've done if I have improved or not when a status on targets hit is not given Tally it up in a drop down much like the distance markers at the end of each target segment

99_5834_4,Brother,It's great for my brother because he's only four so when Disney comes on I can play this for him so he's not bord 
99_5836_4,Great game messed up with payments,This is a finely crafted bubble shooter with great graphics cute characters and fun gameplay that merits 4 or 5 stars HOWEVER that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in game payments of this sort I HATE this type of payment system I would much rather buy the game up front for 1 2 or even 3 If that option becomes available I would definitely buy this game 
99_5837_4,Nice,Good job

99_5925_4,User unfriendly,Hard to use takes up big chunks of the screen trying to sell me crap
99_5926_4,Highly recommended,It's a app that you can do pretty much everything from making to do list to office papers It's great for people that are on the go and can store almost anything and have it in the palm of their hand

99_7161_5,feature request,Works fine and fun Everything's good now only problem is is like mentioned on by another commentor is the it crashes when u scroll through ship selection other then that little problem it's fun to play good job ubi and it also says theres a Google play edition ship but I cant find it

99_7163_5,feature request,Good but Was running perfectly before the update task killer no working Displays no tasks
99_7164_5,feature request,Pretty good I've edited many photos using this application already Something to probably address is the photo not always saving what you're looking at in the preview The beautify tool is a good example of this as it may look fine in preview but when you save it you don't exactly get the same quality Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated but overall a remarkable app I use this in conjunction with other apps 
99_7165_5,feature request,Galaxy S4 GPE I have a galaxy s4 google play edition and can't save to the external sd card Otherwise great app You can choose the external sd as your save location but it won't save to it 
99_7166_5,feature request,Very good Need to update voice sometime back ground noise comes Thanks
99_7167_5,feature request,Bugged The last update caused the game to stop working It won't even start now Please fix New update still didn't fix anything 
99_7168_5,I wish ,It would pull the contacts I have on facebook but not on my phone and put them on my phone 
99_7169_5,I Need Backups or Dropbox Back,I've had this app for about a year I love it but can you bring back backups or dropbox so I can transfer files to my laptop Please do this
99_7170_5,Okay for chains no good otherwise,Great idea for an app and works okay for gas and chain restaurants but that is literally all you will find No grocery stores cafes or anything that is not fast food or large chains No coffee shops other than Starbucks and no foreign foods and definitely nothing remotely healthy Also lacking an option for submissions I was excited at the possibilities for this app but the reality is much more disappointing 
99_7171_5,Fantastic UI but missing a few features,Clear has one of the best designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone iPad It is the way apps should be So simple and easy I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings 1 It would be nice to sync with the desktop iCal and between devices 2 It needs Reminders and Alerts and Due Dates etc 3 Some kind of support for longer notes Right now single tapping an item lets you edit the item Maybe double tapping should let you open an item's detail page where you could enter the due date add an alarm or type a longer note 4 Also sharing a list It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists Though now I admit this is feature creep that could detract from Clear's simplicity 
99_7172_5,Not bad,I just wish it would notify me if I go below a certain dollar amount
99_7173_5,Oh well ,They should add the function to buy Starbucks gift cards via iTunes store I wonder if they'll add that when iOS6 comes in with passbook 
99_7174_5,Please integrate with WW Kitchen,I also like WW Kitchen and often add my own recipes It would be great if the two apps were integrated so if I added a recipe in WW Kitchen I could pull it up in WW Mobile 
99_7175_5,Needs,They should add the photo editting option Then this app would be perfect 
99_7176_5,Suggestion for Hold Mail,It seems like it would be a great addition to have the hold mail feature from your website here also Please include this in the next release 
99_7177_5,Multitasking ,It's almost 2011 Where is the multitasking 
99_7178_5,GRADES,Requires access to grades and it'll get 5 strs in my book
99_7179_5,Convenient App,Great App Useful and easy to use 
99_7180_5,5 6 days please ,3 days won't do I need at least 5 days Seems user friendly and easy to follow Perhaps if it added the ingredients not multiple entries for the some onion per se 
99_7181_5,Good but still needs some extra options,It's very convenient to use however not being able to switch between accounts without un linking the phone would be great Also an improvement in the media player would also help
99_7182_5,,One feature they should add is being able to import multiple photos to camera roll then it be better
99_7183_5,Things Dropbox needs,Would be nice to have a grid view of photos other than just the auto upload of camera roll Also would be nice to rename files My last review still not fixed This app doesn't support mobi file uploads Would be nice to save my mobi files
99_7184_5,Like the new design,Is Dropbox design for iOS 7 but is still the same more or less Air Drop is the only new thing in this update for iPhone I think 4 out of 5 because still can't rename files
99_7185_5,Great,I just wish you could edit your word documents other than that it's great 
99_7186_5,Very usefull app,Thank's for app but can you add offline mod for exmple i want save one video in my iphone and after that play it with VLC
99_7187_5,Update please,We should be able to do text documents 
99_7188_5,Important,If we could create docs inside the app that would be great
99_7189_5,No Gallery,Still no gallery in Camera Upload mode 
99_7191_5,Few requests,Hey Dropbox team Please add the ability to rename files as well as the ability for gifs to play I know you can do it 
99_7193_5,Good UI but lacks features,Beautiful app but NEEDS the ability share folders For people on the go we need to be able to email links out to people sending tons of individual links to people is not feasible
99_7194_5,Larger photos,Please include the option to view thumbnail larger while viewing in the photo folder
99_7195_5,Print,Would love to be able to print right from the app instead of having to go through the browser or open it in another app Otherwise very convenient
99_7196_5,Update is a step backwards ,I've been using Dropbox for quite sometime now I have earned a fair amount of space and I love being able to access all my files from my iPhone iPad MacBook and the Internet via anyone else's computer But these last 2 updates have disabled the save to camera roll feature which I use all the time and have come across several times since the new update Please please please add this feature back I know I can just do a screen shot but i prefer the clean cut copy you receive without boarders from saving images to the camera roll 
99_7197_5,Bookmarks and Highlights,I love this app but I do wish I could highlight words in PDFs and create bookmarks Would this be possible at some piont 
99_7198_5,Pretty good app but , Why can't I sign into separate Drop Box accounts 
99_7199_5,That's Great,You should put the folders first And then the files I would put a folder as favorite thus putting all the files inside this as favorite too
99_7200_5,Love but,Can we get push notifications for other things being shared besides just folders My bf is a photographer he often sticks photos in our shared folder would like a notification when things arrive I do have them turned on but never get them 
99_7201_5,Well thought out and easy to quickly access,The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful and makes accessing files on the go far more convenient I also think the latest style refresh is a big positive in the right direction I use dropbox on all of my devices I would like to see sorting within the app improved eg by date but it's good otherwise
99_7202_5,Needs GIF support ,Please add support for animated GIFs 
99_7203_5,Super easy to keep notes organized,I love the app for allowing me to keep my notes organized and synchrd across devices I also love the feature of sharing stuff with mates The only thing I long for is collaboration on notes
99_7204_5,Premium with ads What gives ,I have a premium account and I use Evernote for business and personal items all day long and I am very frustrated about the new advertisement section I've been graced with despite paying not to have advertisements Also there is no logic behind the new tag section I really like the the tag section but I want to organize what pops up there I can't find a master list of reminders in the app or the desktop version Maybe I haven't looked hard enough but this seems to be a gaping oversight A calandra would be nifty as well
99_7205_5,Good but could be a lot better,The app present good features but there is a lot of bugs and missing some hotkeys to make the writing easier
99_7206_5,Great product,I love pasting notes to ever note I paste my passwords I paste copies of receipts and anything that I need to locate later and I can easily find it in one location the search option is very handy as well I WISH THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE CLEARER
99_7207_5,Evernote,This is a very useful and helpful app In my opinion the only thing it's missing is video handling You can add pictures and audio to your notes and I think you should be able to add videos too
99_7208_5,Great,Does almost everything except allowing me to make a quick diagram by hand But it does allow me to take a pic and record voice so that helps
99_7209_5,Now my main note program,This has become my main notes program Wish I could do handwriting on it Love how can I can put outlook emails in it Using more than my other note apps in the iPad
99_7210_5,Great organizer,This is really a great app an tool to manage multiple projects and scattered notes I just wish that there was a calendar integration and sub folders within stacks Also in Evernote hello there is no categorizing But make no mistake I swear by this program
99_7211_5,Amazing ,Thanks Evernote for a great app I use it DAILY to keep my gluten free dairy free recipes organized A tip Please allow me to search ALL my notebooks helpful to locate an ingredient rather than searching within each notebook individually Also I would love to pay a flat fee to be able to access my notes offline Thanks
99_7212_5,Please add scroll bar and useful word search ,I would give this 5 stars if it had these two additional features Ability to use a scroll bar on iPad and iPhone rather than swipe swipe swipe and more swipe to get to the bottom of a note Ability to keyword search AND GO TO THAT KEYWORD like you can on the laptop version Having search feature for a word does me no good if I can't search within the note to find that word Can you do these two things for iOS please 
99_7213_5,Almost Perfect,Great information is available Wish maps locations of newer hotels were updated more Also would love to have an individual resort map of all the resorts available to view Would be great if age of property and renovation dates were included for hotels too
99_7214_5,Great App,I tend to provide reviews on the fly and my only wish is that I could edit them through the app I also wished that there was a way to respond to replies One hotel accurately described itself on TripAdvisor but was misleading on its website but I can't point this out
99_7215_5,Great App wsearching for hotels,This app has been very helpful on my honeymoon search It would be nice to be able to enlarge the photos though Other than that it's perfect
99_7216_5,Needs Offline Functionality,Great app beautiful layout But I wish saved items could be viewed offline 
99_7217_5,Why force landscape ,Still landscape only So weird Every other app has the ability to go either direction Too bad
99_7218_5,I agree with 4,They need to show B B small inns
99_7219_5,Landscape support please ,Please add landscape support for your fat fingered users 
99_7220_5,feature request,Great application One of the great application for chat Please just increase the upload limit That will be very useful
99_7221_5,feature request,Increase participants in a group increase participants in a group Update it
99_7222_5,feature request,awesome bt plz increase the size videos that we send
99_7223_5,feature request,No Galaxy Gear support Please create an app for Galaxy Gear I can only read the notifications on my Gear I would love to have an option to reply directly from my Gear Thanks
99_7224_5,feature request,Hope it had whatsApp to sms though 
99_7225_5,feature request,One thing needed You should be able to have sub boards For example You would have the board Food Then on the board food you could have a sub board for dessert Or healthy Our brunch
99_7226_5,feature request,I've been addicted forever The only thing I would change is that over time I want it more organized so I make another board I wish there was a 'move pin' button to place it to another board current technique is having to repin then delete it from the old board
99_7227_5,feature request,Great Only complaint is being able to change the picture that represents your boards And just a user friendlier way to change settings and customizeadd pictures to your boards
99_7228_5,feature request,Perfect Vry gud app for editingplz add some more interesting frame 
99_7229_5,feature request,Wonderful but Could be better if all tools built in and not depending upon the network connection
99_7231_5,Still cannot change file names,Still no ability to change file names a very basic function Hard to believe after this amount of time Error messages when simply trying to move files No response from dropbox
99_7232_5, Open In option still missing,I hoped the update would bring back the 'open in' option but it didn't Importing files into other apps is a major pain now Why was this option removed Please bring it back
99_7233_5,Bad,Very slow uploading and poor background uploading does it really need 3h to upload several megabyte video over 10 Mbit internet 
99_7234_5,Sharing,I can't share folders That was the only reason I made a Dropbox in the first place Ugh
99_7235_5,Voicememo,How to add voice memo from the iPhone 
99_7236_5,Where is the download multiple feature ,This would easily be a 5 star app Best idea ever But it loses 2 stars just because I have to download one photo at a time This is a huge inconvenience
99_7237_5,Still no folder refresh Pathetic,Even Google Drive can refresh folders Some simple suggestions to increase usability 1 Currently you have to leave the folder and come back in if you wish to refresh that folder Let me refresh my folder with a refresh button so that I can view changes to files in a more streamlined manner If I am constantly compiling a document on my computer and using my iPad to check that it looks okay or if I am constantly editing a photo and want a high quality true color representation then REFRESH 2 Refresh Button 3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents 4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it 5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button 6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker 7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely 8 Give me an R Give me an E Give me an F Give me an R Give me an E Give me an S Give me an H What does that spell Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to people who don't know they need it yet Yaaay 
99_7238_5,PDF viewer is buggier than ever,This update would be a step up if you could actually see PDF's with it
99_7239_5,Dropbox desktop GREAT Device App NOT,When I put things into my dropbox folder on my desktop I can find files by date modified by name etc The app has an incomprehensible and un modifyable sorting function It's almost impossible to find files within the app Once you find them on your phone I believe you can 'favorite' them But the challenge is to find them
99_7240_5,Sync fail,Was good until the cent updates Now my notes vanish randomly and I keep getting a sync error This app needs added features too
99_7241_5,Useful app some bugs,Some places that had menus on the old version are missing them on the new one Other than that the app is extremely helpful and easy to use Much improved navigation
99_7242_5,Not feeling the update,The new update loads slower closes out on me when i press BACK from viewing photos this update has glitches I don't like the search method and I wish you guys would make it easier to find RESORTS hotels similar to the ones you previously looked at like if I viewed a few months ago a 5 star resort with a lazy river it show me similar resorts I would like to stay at in another place state country 
99_7243_5,FILTERING A HOTEL SEARCHA FLAW,It is impossible to refine a hotel search for specific criteria beyond location price and quality Those are well done and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA Especially during peak seasonal flows many of us travel with pets We have a terrible time finding clean reliable hotels Most sites for pet travel are woefully inadequate How hard would it be to include this as an additional search filter That would bring in helpful reviews that would not only enhance the site experience but also improve the field
99_7244_5,feature request,Useful improved Happy with the progress on this app but there are many updates that seem to make no change Can't see the names of many boards there needs to be a wrapped text function on board names so long board names can be seen Indexing is very slow too many of my pins take weeks to come up in search
99_7245_5,feature request,Video playback sucks This is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser then to youtube Please allow for in app playback to bypass all the nonsense
99_7246_4,user experience,Does exactly what it says on the tin Effecient enough to check and respond to my emails
99_7247_4,user experience,Best of what's available I've purchased a few of these word emulator apps and Office Suite is the best It's very easy to edit with the toolbars I would give it a five but there are some word spacing issues and I've lost edits occasionally when saving to Dropbox
99_7248_4,user experience,Finally an Office Suite which works great I have gone through so many office suite and tried to find the suite which best support most common Microsoft Office suite applications Finally this suite fills that suite to 80 If the Font package was part of the suite then I would have given 95 and 5 star 
99_7249_4,user experience,Aside from the occasional glitch pretty good Awesome graphics nice sound just don't expect AC3 or 4 scale naval warfare The battles are not what I'd call real time more a cross between real and turn based Randomly sailing about is also quite pointless due to being able to fast travel almost anywhere The main missions and races are fun however as they are much less repetitive than battling There have been a few bugs but the developer seems to be squashing them quite often 
99_7250_4,user experience,Great app Found my Canon MX880 printer Worth the money as none of the other free applications worked to my liking 
99_7251_4,user experience,I like using this application for my embroidery business Enjoy using this application for my business 
99_7252_4,user experience,Funny Funny and exciting app You can can have new way of expressing yourself and you can make fun with others photos 
99_7253_4,user experience,Works I needed a app that allowed me to print to my house using my wifi This app worked perfectly and easy to setup Make sure you share your printer if using a home network and an install all the drivers for that printer If not may have issues 
99_7254_4,user experience,The best I really like the features especially the stickers 
99_7255_4,user experience,Awesome PDF performance Latest update has improved PDF viewing performance by a significant amount No more waiting for the content to appear while swiping through pages 
99_7256_4,user experience,Love it I really love this game game play is amazing and for this being a mobile based game the graphics are stunning 
99_7257_4,user experience,Beautiful Keep it up this far is the most usable app editor it makes my photos more beautiful and alive 
99_7258_4,user experience,Just the link needed Perfect solution for my Android Linux environment Works well with Tasker 
99_7259_4,user experience,Excellent From the developers of the best file manager for android Works like a charm on my S4 Droid Razr and Note II 
99_7260_4,Beautiful but no landscape ,Very useful But it is difficult sometimes trying to type an essay without landscape mode It is ridiculous how a word processing app doesnt let u type landscape 
99_7261_4,For young children,This is a short Halloween story There are several puzzles and a simple story showing Mickey who is later joined by friends My 2 1 2 year old will probably like it but the 4 year old will be bored quickly For one dollar this is ok 
99_7262_4, Lose It is a better ap with no fees ,I just blew 54 to sign up for three months of Weight Watchers because of this ap only to discover that this ap is not nearly as good as the free ap called Lose It When my Weight Watchers membership expires I will continue watching my food intake with Lose It Meanwhile I am monitoring my progress using both aps so the transition will be seemless So far I'm finding that Lose It is much faster and easier to use 
99_7263_4,Good deals,Who doesn't like a good deal every now then Usually something for everybody and easy user interface Pretty thorough app
99_7264_4,clean design,super convenient and nice with new alerts 
99_7265_4,Mr David,App works fine for basic bank accounts 
99_7266_4,Good time killer,Good to pass time
99_7267_4,Fun free game ,Harder than I thought it would be fun and neat 
99_7268_4,Mata,Love this app You decide how you want your collage They should add more variety of frames 
99_7269_4,Great app,I love having all my photos backed up automatically and not having to keep them on my phone
99_7270_4,Reliable Period,Have been using Google Drive for a few months paid account the desktop app was totally unreliable and failed to sync just too often So came back to Dropbox always syncing smartly and reliably A bit pricey though almost twice as expensive as competitions if you want the extra space
99_7271_4,recent update,I now see that you must have IO7 or better for the app I didn't wish to upgrade to IO7 on my ipad2 and can't on my orginal ipad I feel you guys tossed us out in the cold
99_7272_4,File sharing with ease,That moment I figured out I could transfer photos from my iPhone to laptop faster via dropbox than plugging my phone into the USB port
99_7273_4,Hi,I love the idea of Dropbox but my cloud does the same thing My videos take a really long time to upload I think it froze If the app didn't take up space on my iPad then I would be impressed 
99_7274_4,Access 247,Convenient No more lugging the laptop or losing a thumb drive My files are accessible anytime anyone from any of my devices or another's With three full time students in the house the affordable upgrade holds docs data music and more Lots of room available More convenient and more affordable than an external drive
99_7275_4,Good,Nice UI Keep up the good work 
99_7276_4,Excellent,I love the new design for iOS 7
99_7277_4,Looking good,New interface is great
99_7278_4,Great,It's a great app especially for iphone users since they can't add storage to their phones but any time u send a email to a friend inviting them to get it they give you more memory
99_7279_4,Good app,Works well especially for saving files for offline use
99_7280_4,One of the finest apps I have seen,Simple to use And the voice recognition is great 
99_7281_4,So good and will keep getting better,My wife and I share a 100GB account and it's amazing So many things Automatic photovideo upload iPhoto import works with the Mailbox app shared folders photo aggregation on the website and mobile the ability to store files only on the cloud saves space on my Mac from old files and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real time and accessibility of my files from anywhere I could do without it anymore Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files One suggestion if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll say for TBT don't automatically re upload it to Camera Imports It's already in Dropbox silly And yes obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload
99_7282_4,Must Have App ,This is a must have App as you can set it to sync all your pictures and once you take one they are saved in the cloud and also accessible by any other device you have Dropbox installed on and are signed into One amazing MUST HAVE product and App xx
99_7283_4,Even easier to sync stuff,I use Dropbox for everything Having this available easily on my phone made checking updates on projects from work to sharing items much easier when I'm not at a computer Also makes it easy to get photos from phone to computer since I never seem to move them Shameless plus here works great combined with Ifttt to move post record things on calendar emails contacts via spreadsheet or special folders
99_7284_4,Love the program,Not sure how I lived without it Best way I know to keep all my important files in one place so I can access them from anywhere on any device 
99_7285_4,Amazing App,Dropbox is amazing and perfect for storage and safety I love it I just wish there was an option to change the name of pictures and documents through your phone
99_7286_4,Very handy useful tool for syncing and sharing files,I use it to sync files between a desktop laptop iPad iPod and iPhone And for collaborating with others by using shared files and folders I once had a problem on my iPad with an endless loop asking me to connect to iTunes But that turned out to be an Apple problem which for me could only be solved by a complete erase and restore Since the problem only occurred in DropBox I initially assumed it was their problem It was not
99_7287_4,The only cloud app that works,I've tried Google Drive Box Skydrive but none of them could upload a 20 minute video I took Dropbox was the only one that accepted my file
99_7288_4,54gb of memory,I can pretty much have access to all my photos and videos on the go without it taking space on my phone Love ittt 3
99_7289_4,Awesome,Dropbox works great I can access files anywhere Highly recommend
99_7290_4,Easy to use,Simple just what I needed to make transferring certain photos from phone to computer and vice versa simple Thanks 
99_7291_4,Great app missing one really important function,This app is really useful for having access to documents while I'm out The one big thing I think it lacks is a way to share folders while you're using the app I'd love to be able to share a folder via the app and I've needed to so this before while I was out but unfortunately this app as of 3113 doesn't have that feature It would be really useful to have 
99_7292_4,Good,Very convenient for moving files without connecting to a computer 
99_7293_4,Failing after today's update,I rely on Dropbox for syncing daily annotated PDFs from my iPad to my home computer After today's update sync stopped working
99_7294_4,Excellent,It's a really good cloud app but what makes it stand out is the new pdf viewer Now I can read huge files on the iPad You can't do that on Google Drive's app
99_7295_4,Yay sort by date ,This was a long wait very glad to have this feature 
99_7296_4,PDF viewer is a game changeralmost,I use several apps for PDF viewing and one feature that keeps me on the prowl for the holy grail of PDF viewers is an app that supports PDF markup Being a musician and heavy e reader I rely heavily on PDF markup Dropbox give us some simple PDF markup abilities eg highlight pen erase opacity and you will put several PDF viewer apps to bed Couple these features with the ability to share a folder of PDFs with other Dropbox users and you've converted me and countless others to PDF viewing through Dropbox
99_7297_4,Wow,The new PDF reader is AWESOME 
99_7298_4,Great app but,It takes forever to upload photos 2 3 weeks after I started the photos finally became viewable I had no problems installing the last update I love the recent upgrades Syncs perfectly Sharing is easy Overall a great app but needs a few tweaks
99_7299_4,Very productive ap ,This works wonderful on my iPhone 4S I have many things on my PC and it automatically syncs to my iPhone I am never without important documents that I need to review or look up that are password encoded Super easy and a huge time saver Love it 
99_7300_4,15 min streaming limit,I gotta say overall I like this app although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth The reason is because I start downloading the whole file then start streaming it Once the 15 min is up I then switch to the downloaded file To me this uses more data Why can't I just stream the whole thing Overall though I like everything else about this app
99_7301_4,Good app,Nice and smooth photo streaming from device to device
99_7302_4,SIX stars,Honestly it took me some time to get used to using this application web clipping photo notes sharing etc but now I find this app to be the 'deal killer' the one thing that MUST be on every device The note scanning is so powerful it can read my scribbles take notes in a meeting take pics in evernote throw them out We are now exploring the business application sky's the limit
99_7303_4,Use it for everything,It's wonerful I keep recipes receipts knitting patterns copies of postcards and greeting cards from friends car maintenance records appliance manuals parts numbers for appliance parts and many other things I keep schedules for my favorite sports teams information about attractions I would like to visit the next time I travel to various cities I keep business cards and journal articles that I use at work Easy to search for information when I need it
99_7304_4,Why not be more generous ,Good app for noting but too expensive to use it for poor students 60mb is not enoughcould you make it more plz 
99_7305_4,Would benefit trying again,Green interface doesn't look or feel good Nor is it more useful Maximizing space to type in should be the goal however it doesn't feel like it The app still works It's clunky and advertising too much It probably isn't even an issue they may have rolled out the advertisements at the wrong time
99_7306_4,Enjoyed it,I started to use evernote since high school but didn't feel that useful Now i am a college student I use evernote in every life I love the highlight section but wish there is more color than yellow Moreover I enjoy the website version as well It is organized and sophistic Thank you for providing this application It is so convenience
99_7307_4,Evernote is the best for productivity,Once I learned to use the notebookmultiple tag search I was very pleased with the new update I use Evernote for my GTD system and primarily work on iPad The new graphics are great Thanks for my most used app
99_7308_4,Amazing app however,The most amazing app for sure the most used on my iPad however I liked some features of the older version please bring back the option to make Paragraph headers and subsections The typing could be faster but Still great app
99_7309_4,Fix the camera album bug ,I like the UI improvements with the new version The old UI was hideous and I usually used En via another app like drafts or IFTTT But the fact that I cannot add recent photos from my album This is the main function for me of Evernote This must be fixed 
99_7310_4,Good for Me,I like the concept and automation using the subject line
99_7311_4,Indespensible,I use EN constantly through the day for various productivity tasks It performs well and all my devices are always in sync so my files and notes are always handy No crashes or complaints with the new design It just works and I love it
99_7312_4,Brilliant Service Awful design,I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college It's a wonderful service and up until the iOS7 redesign the apps have always worked great But the design of this app is terrible It's jumbled confusing and lots of advertising for their service add ons and 'news' get in the way of core functionality Please redesign the app Again
99_7313_4,Sales pitches for premium users and broken features,This version still has a marketplace full of ads I can't hide and the image attachment only shows me pics from September and earlier So it's pretty useless Quit trying to sell me stuff and fix your bugs 
99_7314_4,Pure Awesome,The only reason I moved to iOS7 was to get the newest version of Evernote Let me say I have no idea what everyone is complaining about Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Handy announcements from Evernote The card view is still there you just have to gasp look for a sec If you are having issues contact support before blasting the app And take a deep breath folks Life isn't that bad
99_7315_4,Evernote App,The app is missing a few things compared to the computer based version but overall functionality is pretty good The only reason I don't give the app 5 stars is because the new interface is absolutely ugly Although this is just a personal opinion I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing If this changes I will give it 5 stars
99_7316_4,Not thrilled with iOS 7 version,I love love love Evernote It is the only way I remember anything Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible The new interface seems to have buried things I want most Such as Sync Now and Search Sync seems to be broken regardless I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does using my first sentence Another new annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again working like the desktop version would be better here Finally it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault It is the buggiest iOS I can remember I'm not mad Just frustrated 2 stars is a reflection on the iOS version not the Evernote across platforms
99_7317_4,v7 does not sync,My Mac OS X version is working fine but the app does not upload my data until I soft reset the phone Useless iOS 7 iPhone 5
99_7318_4,Great App ,I've used other note taking apps before but this is my favorite I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of all its capabilities but I love the fact that it will sync across all my devices My notes are easy to find It would've great if there was a way to hide some of my notebooks with a password for secure data That's the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five
99_7319_4,Needs some tweaking,Great app that I have used regularly but seems a bit jerky since the iOS 7 update and update of app itself A bit off putting when trying to type 
99_7320_4,Note size limit ,I use evernote for most of my note taking but now I have to pay 5 dollars a month just for a slightly longer note Ridiculous 
99_7321_4,Great for paper clutter,I am using this to reduce paper clutter in my house So far so good Notes from the kids' school and organizations get photographed and organized in one notebook Notes for parties in another Ideas for the house are organized too including pictures from home and garden magazines Love it so far I am a little worried however that I need access to the Internet for it Not sure if this will work then
99_7322_4,Lost Everything ,I loved Evernotesthat is Until I download iOS7 With their new and improved look they also did away with everything you ever had saved They did however manage to maintain the notebook namesunfortunately all of the notes within those notebooks were erased I used this app for work and personal businessall files gone Be sure to only use this app for unimportant notes Very disappointed 
99_7323_4,Had to delete and reinstall to fix missing data,I have over 200 notes in Evernote verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted and reinstalled it Logging out and logging back in didn't work The new UI will take some getting used to but feels cleaner and faster than before
99_7324_4,A must have app,I have to say that Evernote is in the top 3 ranking of my productivity apps if not number 1 So simple to use I use it to store all sorts of data that I need to be able to recall quickly Great for note taking recipes software keys wifi settings Endless uses
99_7325_4,great app for projects recipes,Easy camera function allows for adding recipes right to notebook Separate notebooks make keeping all pieces of a project together regardless of media Used it for remodeling projects and it's where I keep my collection of recipes regardless of initial source Have used it for about a year and unlike other apps I'm still using it
99_7326_4,Fabulous ,Absolutely love this app Found out about it from a fellow Southwestair flyer Use it all the time for 'must saves' from twitter the internet Easy to use with folders tags Can keep all of my daily notes thoughts close at hand
99_7327_4,Just gets better with use,The more I use Evernote the more ways I find to use it Love the excellent and consistent multi platform experience and sync
99_7328_4,Great,Syncs great with desktop Allowing me to keep my thoughts organized and accessible
99_7329_4,Vital in digital age,Keeps track of any and everything and just keeps getting better Whether it is a document or a picture it can be captured ether by email or snapping a photo and you then have it forever Retrieving it is simple by tags or searching It just makes life simpler
99_7330_4,Surprised to be using it so much,After I downloaded this it just sat on my desktop for a million years Then I got the bright idea of taking a screen snapshot of an Expedia itinerary Wow Suddenly I am off and running saving and accessing info on everything from learning disabilities to salad dressings I would like it better if there were multi layer nesting available for the notebooks but it is pretty cool Btw I use the skitch add on for editing reformatting bold print etc It's great
99_7331_4,I loved Evernote until today,Evernote is now virtually unusable I was simply trying to toggle check marks in my grocery list yesterday and it would take three or more attempts to acknowledge me and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up without any reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list When the program did finally acknowledge me the check marks would be delayed by about 2 seconds each as if it had to stop and sync between every gesture Do people even test apps before release any more Who thought 'Oh yeah this looks perfect ' should be fired
99_7332_4,good for what I need,Probably the beat all around note taking app good for pretty much everything
99_7333_4,It just works Great,A wonderful substitute for loss of brain function in middle age It remembers everything for me across platforms 
99_7334_4,This app is a complete waste,Not worth your time unless you like to be disappointed
99_7335_4,Evernote saves marriages,From baby feeding and diaper changes to shopping lists and research papers our family shares everything Thanks Evernote 
99_7336_4,New User Loves It So Far,As stated in the title I am a new user Even though I've only been using Evernote for about two months I have come to greatly depend on it It is fabulous to be able to record a meeting and take notes at the same time I can't imagine anything better I hope to find out all the other ways I can use it 
99_7337_4,Evernote,I love Evernote and feel so organized now I like being able to take pictures and use it often for business cards I have recommended to friends I can't live without my Evernote
99_7338_4,Bee useful and powerful,I love this ap use it on the go but also to store travel info to easily access Also like web integration
99_7339_4,Changed my life ,The only app I couldn't live without Practical easy to use beautiful design user experience use it multiple times per day
99_7340_4,Fantastic app,I love to write Inspiration for words can come at the drop of a hat which why I absolutely love this app I have the ability to record thoughts at my finger tips by having the app on my phone then can go back and work on the same pieces on my computer later at home The instant syncing between computer and phone is fantastic It's perfect for writing recipes or absolutely anything really Very satisfied 
99_7341_4,Great organizing tool,I use it to keep track of recipes make notes on hobbies keep up with maintenance tasks
99_7342_4,Useful above all,This is a wonderful app that enables users to write about whatever they need in a variety of ways on a variety of devices
99_7343_4, 450 is too much,It's a lot of money for what a mounts to a great sorting system for notes if you're a flake like me Looking back I should just have kept those little slips of paper in my pocket
99_7344_4,The best,Afterr trying many organizers over the last year I am settling on Evernote Is easiest and most intuitive to use syncs so easily to laptop
99_7345_4,Love,Golly this app makes my memory obsolete I never have to recall anything again it's here it's on my computer it's on the interwebs Weee 
99_7346_4,Essential Tool,I use Evernote for work and personal use I was an early adopter and have found it to be an incredibly useful tool for productivity personal reference and as an idea base It is extremely reliable intuitive and something I use many times a day I love it and highly recommend it to others
99_7347_4,Quite good,Impressed by its versatility in terms of the type of note one can take It's great to have the ability to input URL photos audio and text And great that it has desktop integration for a computer The drawback that I've encountered is though it offers labels it doesn't offer folders Editing and the dashboard in the app could use an easier interface Still good app though
99_7348_4,Daily go to,Evernote is my daily Goto app for all of my actions and to dos The file folder UI can be clunky but under the covers this app delivers
99_7349_4,Replaces a dozen three ring binders,I've been using this for just over 6 weeks and have eliminated all paper notes Even when I find myself at a meeting without a laptop or iPad my paper notes easily get loaded in simply by snapping a photo Additionally classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to organize among a couple different dimensions for easy retrieval at a later date
99_7350_4,Love it ,I'm loving the organization and ease Evernote brings to my life It's new reminders feature has been amazing 
99_7351_4,Great tool ,Have been using Evernote forfiver a year now very easy to use program love the syncing with my desktop phone iPad etc

99_7353_4,Good stuff,Simple easy to use note taking app Sometimes not all notes are available when not on wireless network
99_7354_4,Must have for a writer ,As a writerdaydreamer I'm constantly in my head thinking up new ideas and having a tool that allows me to access my material pretty much anywhere is fantastic Instead of just jotting down a note which I can't always do and referring to it later on once I've gotten home logged onto a computer opened up a Word document it's so much easier and convenient to do it on this app I've even used Evernote for school stuff essays mostly so there's no need for emailing documents to myself There are only a few errorsglitches that I've encountered but nothing that makes me want to stop using this app I love it too much 
99_7355_4,Great app ,Syncs well and wonderful for projects at work and home
99_7356_4,Great tool for my notes,I love the fact that Evernote allows me to sync my notes between each of my devices and computers I use it everyday to keep everything right in front of me I wish the interface a bit different Maybe the option of colored notes 
99_7357_4,Great super versatile notes app,Editing ability and consistency on iPhone has improved with recent updates Still some work to do to allow additional font sizes and such for items created on iPhone Should get a 45 for that reason but it would be unfair to rate this a 4 bc of those minor limitations Robust editing on Mac online allow workarounds
99_7358_4,Must Have Stores Everything,Ok what don't I use Evernote for Nothing I use for everything Storing contacts business cards my son's artwork recipes food journals workout logs useful documents receipts magazine clippings In this new version I can finally edit notebooks on my phone I'm 99 mobile I love that you can access your notes from anywhere My husband has the Evernote pen an takes notes during his meetings He looses his notebooks but the pen syncs with Evernote and all his handwritten notes are there Super cool I also use Evernote Food App which syncs with Evernote Awesome

99_7360_4,Time saver ,This app has made my job and life so much easier It is available on all platforms and syncs automatically There are updates all of the time I have been using this for about a year now and I have never had an issue with losing notes I use this to write my notes for billing so that part is crucial Thanks for making my life easier 
99_7361_4,Terrific resource ,I love Evernote The convenience of saving web info documents from airline itineraries to e tickets to office documents to photos etc on my IPad or my computer is wonderful The fact it works on pc platforms is a real bonus Put the info on one device and you have it on all your devices Thank you developers 
99_7362_4,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT ,ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AND MOST USED APPS ON MY IPOD I USE IT TO WRITE JOURNAL ENTRIES TAKE NOTES AT CHURCH JOB MEETINGS ETC ONE OF IF NOT THE BEST NOTETAKING APPS EVER HANDS DOWN And believe me I've tried a lot of them 
99_7363_4,Very good app,There is always room for improvement but this app has replaced no less than 3 other apps and now with reminders it is my go to application for pretty much anything task or project related
99_7364_4,Blissful,This app is in a word blissful Seriously everything I want and need to do and all the ways I want to take notes annotated and tagged images clippings articles news reports etc offered in a nicely bound package that helps keep organized Its like sticky notes moleskins pages zotero and Instagram all in one
99_7365_4,Fantastic ,I'm a writer and so I was always constantly using the original notes app that comes with apple products But it strangely deleted all my notes twice So I decided I needed something better I went through many different note taking apps but none sufficed Then I found Evernote and was so pleased Thank you guys so much You make note taking fun and easy 
99_7366_4,Very Good App,This is a great app for organizing notes recipes etc across devices I use it both at home and work I will enter info on my iphone ipad or on my PC
99_7367_4,Indispensable,I use this app constantly to log and recall business cards notes to do's wine art inspiration quoteseverything
99_7368_4,Great 2nd brain ,This is by far the best organizational app around I use it dozens of times a day for everything from work to helping me plan my wedding to grocery shopping lists Excellent
99_7369_4,It's my memory bank ,No more magazine clippings One place for to do lists Would love to see the ability to set alarms and send reminders One of my favorite and most versatile apps
99_7370_4,Complain,I would like to say that I do not like the fact that the password has to be reset
99_7371_4,Good But Wireless Integration,Easy to use for quick concise note taking Would be fantastic if you could freehand and if the compatibility with wireless keyboards was more efficient Example Apple 'Command' key cannot control boldunderliningitalics functions You still have to use screen
99_7372_4,Web clipping,I use it all the time I especially like the web clipper and then emailing right from Evernote
99_7373_4,Great app for students,Great for slow note takers I use it for all my classes wish there was a bullet option

99_7377_4,Great app,I am enjoying this app and how I can place items that I want to review at a later time I use it to save recipes or articles of interest to read at a later time
99_7378_4,My favorite organization tool ,I absolutely love being able to save notes and organize them in notebooks I use this app daily Two of my most useful notebooks are 1 Storing recipes 2 Medical info such as current meds I also love that I can view it all on various devices I do wish that when sharing the notes they didn't look like garble when I use colors and formatting Also I haven't found an undo option on the app version so when I accidentally delete content I have to do it over The app still deserves 5 stars hands down though 
99_7379_4,Remarkable,I have had this program for over a year now I use it for all my note taking No more pads Easy to share information with staff with a few key strokes A great app
99_7380_4,Awesome App,Evernote is my go to for everything whether lists meeting notes just things to remember etc The only thing that I wish it had is a date driven 'to do' or reminder Then it would be the only app I would ever use for all things productivity
99_7381_4,Great app,This is a great app and I use it on all of my devices This thing is awesome for downloading your brain into your mobile devices
99_7382_4,Fantastic App ,I use this app all the time to keep track of notes recipes general info favorite restaurants etc I do some organizing up front but the real benefit is everything is then searchable and available on both my computers phone and tablet Excellent and useful 
99_7383_4,Productive and amazing,This app is a must have for those in the professional world It is a great way to stay 'green' by storing documents rather than printing hard copies The ability to search notes and PDFs makes old fashioned pen and paper obsolete The integration with Penultimate is pleasing for those who still wish to 'write' rather than type
99_7384_4,Among the Best Productivity Apps,Perhaps the most used app on my mobile devices Well organized easy to use Great product
99_7385_4,Greatest Note taking app available,I use my iPad to take notes for business meetings It automatically synchs with my iPhone and laptop

99_7387_4,Very user friendly,Very easy to use on any device or OS
99_7388_4,It is what it is,It is what it says it is which is refreshing A place to collect all the pieces of information that can clutter your life Sure it takes some work on your part to sort it all out but you have to get it in one place first That is what Evernote does best It's on my iPhone iPad and MacBook I use it everyday
99_7389_4,Good app,Had a lot of trouble at first with phone shutting down app for no reason but not as of late Great app for keeping me organized I use for keeping records on equipment
99_7390_4,Great app ,I use this app more than any of the others regardless of category I love the ability to sync on all of my computers so I am always up to speed
99_7391_4,Simple highly effective tool,I love using Evernote for its simplicity ease of use and effectiveness I use this tool for work and personal purposes Mainly for taking notes at work meetings eliminating the paper clutter both work and personal I really like its integration with other SaaS tools Recently switched my wife to Evernote for storing scanned documents
99_7392_4,Great for GTD,Great app for David Allen's 'Getting Things Done' organizational techniques Syncs with iPhone iPad and Mac immediately so you always have access to what you need wherever you are I use this app to keep track of everything from work tasks household chores shopping lists and ideas for the future without getting them mixed up Check out TheSecretWeaponorg for ideas on how to set up your Evernote to stay organized Great app 
99_7393_4,No More Sticky Notes on the Desk,Great app for business purposes Eliminated all handwritten notes and sticky note reminders Great for tagging and clipping important websites and urls Would love to see option to color code notes for us visual organizers Great for checklists and idea sharing with others
99_7394_4,My Auxiliary Brain ,Love it Haven't gotten too much in place yet but already I've come to depend on this Few things to make it 'The One' for my organizing heart in the most drool inducing order 1 Ability to swipe through notes like flipping pages in a books 2 Sub foldersnotebook 3 Ability to highlight re positionable sticky notes are a dream 4 Colors I get cross eyed hunting through a long list of same colored notebooks The ability to sort and organize by color would be wonderful I'd know exactly what section to go to rather quickly This has let me collect my notes from my Palm Blackberry iPhone PCwherever and put them in one place I feel so un scattered Amazing how much information we and Evernote can hold
99_7395_4,It's not one note but it will do for Mac users,I wish ms would release one note on apple though
99_7396_4,Productivity Increase,Great tool to consolidate your notes
99_7397_4,Awesome app,Awesome app allows you to easily create and share notes pictures diagrams and ideas between devices in a highly organized fashion This is good if you're a scatter brain like me and never know when inspiration will strike but would lose it if if wasn't easy to categorize ie traditional postit note model where they don't end up helping because they're everywhere 
99_7398_4,Most versatile app I have acquired ,I love the do anything note capabilities text inline photos audio files web clips which I have yet to become proficient with but will The cross platform access to your notes on the cloud is brilliant and a HUGE time saver This app combined with the inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that I bought recently have given me a power mobile information gathering and organizing capability
99_7399_4,greatest organization tool ,even with the latest glitches evernote is still one of the only apps on my phone i use daily best program to keep up with my life super glad it is on the iphone 
99_7400_4,I quit,Waited for this update then we get this EverNote is no longer for taking text notes It is now obvious to me and I have been in denial for over a year There is no font control editing is random and buggy slow as molasses and unreliable when you take time to write a paragraph you want 100 confidence EverNote will not crash midway or you get Synchronization Fail and thus lose your work Note sorting and text friendly organization ie lists have been thrown out the window for a shiny interface and lots of icons and flashy graphics I can't write with the confidence that EverNote will not crash but HEY I can take a picture of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey EverFail I quit I am canceling my membership today When you get serious about EverNote as a tool for work send me an email Actually don't bother
99_7401_4,Awesome tool ,I love love this app Evernote is so easy to use and very functional when surfing the web It's like having a mini assistant helping take notes 
99_7402_4,It's Crazy to use this, 50 bucks a year to use this iCloud is FREE Why do we have to pay so much money to get access Is there a rule in our iTunes account that we have to like whatever junk they tell us to like 
99_7403_4,Evernote and GTD have changed everything ,I get things done I'm organized I don't waste time at work it's changed my game plan Still learning all the aspects of Evernote it's just opened up a place where I love to work again because I accomplish so much more in less time 5 star review is well deserved 
99_7404_4,The only notes app worth using,This new layout is awesome Use this app daily and love it
99_7405_4,Lexus Sales Consultant,I am extremely excited about the possibilities for tracking my prospects and clients in a user friendly manner with evernotes The Tag and Search functions make it easy to recall prospects who are interested in specific models new and used I can order the searches to look at latest entries first which is very important in my business Many other applications work well but I do have one observation that you should be aware of There seems to be a bug in the search function for notebooks when you do a search in a specific notebook The all notebooks search works fine as does the tag search breakdown All in all this is a great program
99_7406_4,Holiday travel nightmare at dollar,We arrived at dollar with a 2 pm reservation plus the rapid service I signed up for last week It's now been over an hour in line The placed is mobed with hundreds of customers in line yet very very few counters open It's about 40 running There is no where to sit and crying babies and disappointed families in every corner Food is on the floor and the place is complete disarray I will never rent of the dump again I would rather walk Actually if I had walked to Pasadena I would be almost there Plus the staff are rude and ignorant No compassion for the customers standing in this never ending line rather than be with their families for Xmas My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mom She has a whole dinner planned tonight Unfortunately we will be here at dollar waiting for our pre reserved rental car Rush hour starts in 30 minutes that will end any chance of seeing my family tonight Shame on dollar for not properly staffing their rental car center during the important holiday season

99_7414_4,Perfect,Does exactly what you'd want it to do Great in helping me find restaurants Definitely useful
99_7415_4,TripAdvisor is the BEST Travel App ,TripAdvisor is as much a part of my travel plans as my suitcase and change of clothes I love the ability to search for bargains in travel and lodging and get the inside baseball on what I can expect from local hotels and restaurants The iPhone app works flawlessly on my 4S and it is very helpful to have by my side TripAdvisor Five Stars 
99_7416_4,Honest Advice,Consensus averages gives good sense of what to expect Reviewers are generally truthful and steer you straight
99_7417_4,Great Informatipn,Tripadvisor is a great appwebsite that provides excellent common sense critical information for the traveller no matter where you go Conditions of the facilityrestaurant cost service provided by the staff and more are at your fingertips Feedback is provided by actual travelers so you are provided with honest results A definite place to check when you aren't sure 
99_7418_4,Best all 'round travel review app,I've been using advisor for years and apparently I just now getting around to giving it a review Such a huge diversity of focus areas like restaurants hotels and attractions along with a huge user base which increases the value of the app exponentially
99_7419_4,Great,Very helpful for me Love the reviews for helping me find places when I don't have a guide book with me
99_7420_4,Enzozozozo101,This is an overall great update and had made more quickness and also just a smoother running app tripadvisor itself is the best app to find a restaurant or hotel that suits your needs love the consistent users and current up to date reviews only draw is the distance filter is no longer there so it sets 50 mi radius bit far when u want to go 20 or less but besides that amazing 
99_7421_4,Love it ,What a great app Easy to use info is accurate and everything you need to know as a traveler or tourist 
99_7422_4,Solid reliable,No issues on the performance side with this app Like the UI and find it overall easy to navigate and handle
99_7423_4,Great for the frequent traveler,I started using trip advisor when my husband got a traveling job and I occasionally would go with him Since then we have been addicted and I've hooked my parents on it too Great for finding local gems in restaurants and decent hotels I love seeing the trip advisor signs when I go into restaurants now Everyone can be a critic
99_7424_4,Trip Advisor review,Best info on hotels hands down 
99_7425_4,Love Tripadvisor,I user this site for all my travel needs Check out the forums to interact with others making your same trip 
99_7426_4,Love it,Love this app Have it on my iPhone iPad and computer They all sync Nice Use it on the go to look up restaurants and use it to research all our trips The reviews and forums are great trip tools
99_7427_4,Paris trip,Extremely helpful in France We only went to restaurants rated by TA
99_7428_4,Use with caution ,Reviews are great but Tilripadvisor reads them first They review photos too I have a negative review and they wouldn't post the photos Something about the photos not being clear Bullsh t They were mint and I even had my BF take photos and give them to me Ridiculous Speaking the truth is a problem for them I had undercooked chicken and they didn't want to post that I could've been sick If they prefer to alter reviews then why bother 
99_7429_4,Love love love,My family travels ALL the time and this app has been a life saver numerous times I use it for everything now Highly recommend 
99_7430_4,Great site app,My husband and I always use trip advisor before vacations So much useful information
99_7431_4,Awesome app ,Great app to write my reviews on Very user friendly and easy to navigate
99_7432_4,Trip Advisor always my first stop,I always read all the reviews while we are traveling on the road My husband and I crisscross the country every summer and I am the navigator I find most reviewers to be honest if you read all of them or at least half you can get a pretty good opinion Many times I didn't pay attention to a negative review because I thought they had some sort of personal problem and was sorry afterwards Trip advisor is a good opinion to take into account when you are traveling in a new place and have no idea where to go
99_7433_4,A few bugs in the new version,The new complete rewrite version is a disappointment Very slow to no response to photo paging requests lack of hotel search facility for a given city and incomplete searches for hotels These are just a few problems I noted on first use of rewritten app Needs some work Hopefully there will be an update released soon This used to be a great app
99_7434_4,Good Encyclopedia,I find it an useful tool It is helpful to read multiple opinions one can generally wade through the static and determine what fits It has a vast amount of data but be careful and glean from other sources to get information Remember it is a tool to help plan and execute your own trip use many data points and don't look for perfect wisdom Some people's jewels are NOT others treasures Of I had to put a value I would say about 70 accurate including my own ratings I am very picky some people just want to be out of the rain
99_7435_4,Love to travel,Love trip advisor I use it every time I'm out of time for restaurants and have never gone wrong I have tried other food apps and they are not even close to being as accurate A plus is the fact they don't mess with rating fast food restaurants Who needs a star rating for a McDonalds Burger King etc Also very good for finding a good hotel
99_7436_4,Great for exploring,Us this in every city for finding new resturants Most picks are great Locally run and owned A must app for foodies

99_7438_4,Super util,Excelente informacion me encantan las fotos de los turistas
99_7439_4,Awesome,I never book a room without checking the reviews on this site first I love how I can read reviews from 'real' people and not what someone in marketing came up with to entice me into staying I recommend this to everyone 
99_7440_4,Wonderful App,The TripAdvisor App is a shorter and better way to look up something instead of going onto their website and wasting more time Sometimes you can't always find what you are looking for so you have to go on the website but it's the majority I do all of my bookings with TripAdvisor through the app or through the Internet and it still works very well Great job 
99_7441_4,Love the trip ,Trip advisor is an awesome tool to share with others experiences that you've had to allow others to see how a hotel attraction etcis before they make their choice So thank you for having this app 
99_7442_4,What a tremendous resource ,I'm planning a trip to Italy for myself and several friends and the information and reviews on trip advisor have been invaluable How else would I know about cooking classes in Cortona Or about which tours in Rome Florence and Venice are the best value

99_7450_4,Saved trips,Love that you can save your stops on a trip for easy reference We've really benefitted from using Trip Advisor and loce the ease of access that comes with the app
99_7451_4,Nice for Advice ,Love being able to look up the specific areas I'm visiting and have LOCALS chiming in too 
99_7452_4,Not good app doesn't do the website justice,When you search for something and they don't have it in their database the only option you have is to add the place or completely close out and get back in it to go back to the search bar
99_7453_4,Bravo,Great app Very trustworthy and reliable Always works as promised and delivers useful info and travel tips 
99_7454_4,Love it,I like that it gives you more info about the area Like that I get more feedback how is everyone experience And it give more knowledge where and what to do

99_7468_4,A Great Way to find hotels and restaurants ,I use this app quite a bit to find restaurants and hotels both near and far And I contribute quite a bit Definitely worth using 
99_7469_4,Pretty good,It's a good version of the website It's not great for stuff in the US but it's great for international advice and it's an easier platform to post reviews than yelp
99_7470_4,A perfect traveling companion ,We use the recommendations regularly to find restaurants during our travels We are rarely disappointed Need I say more 
99_7471_4,Good app but watch for battery drain,I've been using this app to plan and manage an overseas trip It has Ben great so far withstand couple of minor issues When left running in the background on some modes I think it keeps location services on which seems to be draining my battery faster than usual I'm not sure if it is that or in just using it more than normal It'd be great if there was a way to see my 'saves' sorted by distance as well as a way to mark them as seen Finally when I'm using this while traveling I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review but remind me later waits about 5 minutes and them pesters me again so a star off for that
99_7472_4,First Place to Check,I've been contributing to TripAdvisor for many years now It is the first place I check when heading to a new area for information on hotels restaurants and activities The app on my iPad makes it easy for on the go reviews It is easy to use and quite intuitive in how it works No complaints

99_7476_4,Such an invaluable resource while travelling,I downloaded the city app while I was travelling and was very happy to find that the maps worked even without using data
99_7477_4,Real people real reviews,I like the candor reflected in the reviews Some people like what I like and some propel do not It is usually easy to fit the review to the reviewer and get a good picture of whether the place and the person might like or not care for the same things as I A good source of information for all 'trips'
99_7478_4,Wonderful and easy to use,I prefer it to Kayak and Travelocity
99_7479_4,Very pleased,Love trip advisor on the big screen This app brings the usefulness of the iPhone program to the iPad Thanks for a good program Very useful when on the road to find the best places Thanks to all who take the time to provide reviews I have offered reviews for years and glad others do as well
99_7480_4,Great Travel App,Have used in US Ireland and Continental Europe easy to use good information including location numbers and web site Reviews are personal preference but knowing a majority opinion makes selecting places and events easy
99_7481_4,Ubiquitous,I love that tripadvisor can guide you no matter where you are We had about an hour to kill for lunch in Fresno CA before a return flight home to Texas We found the best Mediterranean restaurant through tripadvisor Thank you Trip Advisor 
99_7482_4,AgreedTrip Advisor Yelp,While visiting in Philippines discovered TA while evaluating lodging choices Then discovered all the related features which included rich info on local eateries and things to see and do Yelp included nothing in the Philippines It's the strong international contribution by the users like me that make this App really good It won a place on my home page
99_7483_4,Excellent resource,Great app website Extremely useful Real life reviews are always better than sales pitch brochures and recommendations I use this a lot even if I'm not traveling The fun of exploring thru this app creates travel dreams and a great education
99_7484_4,Great Site APP,Love the search engine and the reviews though I should read them before I go out more often I like submitting my honest reviews as I see them and am glad people can take what I have to say and make their own opinion I use the site a lot when traveling to search out places to eat and stay and some are spot on and some not That is why you have to make a personal decision on things
99_7485_4,Useful app search features could be more extensive,I found this app pretty helpful overall for finding hotels and reading reviews however the search feature was a bit limited and didn't allow me to filter by brand name easily This would be a nice feature to add
99_7486_4,So far although not very far so good,it's been very helpful with booking a room dining etc the few times I've used it
99_7487_4,Awesomeness ,So easy to use 
99_7488_4,I use it Shop Go and Rate,I use it whenever we travel I'd rather find places and read reviews that others have posted I go and then post my thoughts So far those who use and rate places are very fair and honest What else are you looking for 
99_7489_4,Very VERY Helpful,I work a hotel myself always recommend that our guests post on trip advisor I was browsing looking at our ratings when I found myself browsing other hotels around the country now I want to travel more just to go to the hotels in my saved list Very helpful in reviews I find it better than Yelp Or any other review website
